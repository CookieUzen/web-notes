# 1.1 Introduction 
## Role of Businesses
(_Can help and harm society_)

* Exist to create value worth more than inputs, those who do will thrive and 
* Demand for a business’s goods/services allows for profit for better operations and future investment
* If a business’s output value is lower than that of the input, it can “destroy value,” and lead to its failure; Inefficient input processing
* Non-profit/Gov organizations may “seem” to be less constrained by the market and value-adding obligations. Somewhat an illusion.
* __Capitalism__ $\rightarrow$ forces inefficient organizations to shut, and better organizations can use the freed resources to improve. 

## Inputs and Output
### Input (Resources Used)

__Physical Resources (Land)__: Raw materials and semi-finished (not ready for sale; Electronics, machines)  goods purchased to begin production $\rightarrow$ Agriculture, lumber, oil, etc.

__Financial Resources (Capital)__: Funds needed to setup and invest in a business for it to run. Longer-term financing used to maintain locales, and capital equipment (desks). Shorter-term financing is used to pay for inputs (inventory) and ongoing expenses (salaries).

__Human Resources (Labour)__: People running the business, from managers to employees.

__Enterprise__: Entrepreneurs take risks $\rightarrow$ Establish and drive businesses forward with other inputs.


### Outputs: Goods/Services
__Goods__: Tangible products with measurable characteristics (food, phones). 

__Services__: Intangible physical properties $\rightarrow$ Actions provided by people or algorithms. _Sometimes go hand in hand with goods (restaurant meal pays for the food, and the services by which the food was made)._

__B2B__: Business to Consumer: Common, product/service and consumer.

__B2B__: Business to Business: Business with other for-profit business. 

__C2C__: Customer to Customer: Consumer sells used product or diy product to other consumer.

__C2B__: Consumer to Business: Consumer/End User sells service/product to businesses (Youtuber ad-spaces, freelance).

## Business Functions
(_Mutually dependent, departments created as businesses expand_)

__Cycle__:
1. Marketing (Changes determined)
2. Operations (Cost changes in production) 
3. Finance & Accounts (How much finance required)
4. Human Resources (Are new workers needed? How can they be acquired?)

__Human Resources__: Function that strategically ensures appropriate number of adequately skilled employees are gathered.

* Also $\rightarrow$ Compensation, induction, training, termination. Oversee that employee treatment complies with business operation laws. 
* __Knowledge Economy__: growth makes employees’ collective skill a  great percentage of company’s value. 

__Finance and Accounts__ (AKA: Accounting, Finance, Bookkeeping): Ensure business has sufficient funds for activities. 

* Also $\rightarrow$ Maintaining records, forecasting financial information, paying creditors, assist in determining pricing strategies for profit, evaluate profitability of projects.

__Marketing__: Marketing process $\rightarrow$ Promotion $\rightarrow$ Advertising (just one part). 

* Also $\rightarrow$ Determining product release timing and pricing to the right customers. Consider promotion methods. Determine Wants and needs of segments (customer groups) in market. 

__Operations__ (_AKA: Production_): Improves efficiency of core business activity(s) to be conducted, manages it. 

* Also $\rightarrow$ Plan how goods/services are produced and in what quantities. How to deliver in lowest cost at sufficient quality standard.

## Economic Sectors
__Primary__: Extraction, harvesting, conversion of natural resources or raw materials (i.e. Farming, logging, mining, fishing). Humanity has primarily relied on this until the last few hundred years. 

__Secondary__: Manufacturing, processing, production of products (or semi-finished ones) using said natural resources. (i.e. Construction, steel, automobiles). 

__Tertiary__: (Largest, most profitable) Selling and provision of services. (i.e. Retail, education, transportation). Many are small, but employers like the chain stores Walmart and Target are massive. 

__Quaternary__:  Knowledge-focused service sector, with the rise of information flow, it slowly deviates from _tertiary_ activities (but arguably yet still a part of them). Collecting, repackaging, selling, providing information, as well as web-services, or media. (Programming, Information, R&D, Business Adviser, Design Engineer).

### Chain of Production:

Primary $\rightarrow$ Production (all input accepted) / Manufacturing(tangible input accepted) $\rightarrow$ Services (Tertiary & Quaternary Output) $\rightarrow$ Consumers

_Businesses can operate in 1+ (integrated companies) of sectors, but as the market is fluid, this can change. (Major oil companies drill, refine into products, and sell at stations, “independents” only drill and sell oil for refinement)._

_Car industry: Integration is not dominant (i.e. Elon musk brought to court for wanting to sell Teslas in his company’s dealerships)._

_Fashion: Depends on company. Some chains only design and sell, or add slight manufacturing. Luxury brands increase to maintain quality._

### Production Types:

__Project/Job Based__: One unit manufactured at a time. For large or customized products, where open communication during process is required. Workers are specialized (yacht, haircuts). 

__Batch Production__: Production of similar items in groups by stage. Nowadays common for workers to only be operating machinery (bakeries, textiles). 

__Mass/Intermittent Production__: Production of standardized products in large quantities and generate counter-demand inventories. All stages passing simultaneously, but may include different products in “batch” production as well. Heavy equipment/machinery and worker investment. (Phones, cars). 

__Flow/Continuous__: Process runs 24/7 to reduce cost and efficiency for high value products, highly automated. (Oil/gas, steel). 

## Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship
These people are all: 
> * Innovative  
> * Ambitious  
> * Leaders 

__Intrapreneur__:
Innovate within business
* Less risk
* Access to resources
* Job security
* Individuals who take risks and innovate in large corporations (who can provide many resources), allowing corporations to maintain their power. 

_Intrapreneurship_: Entrepreneurship within an organization. 

__Entrepreneur__:
* Increased freedom
* More responsibility
* Higher Return of Investment (ROI)
* Individual with talent, perseverance, risk-taker. 

_Entrepreneurship_: Process of creating and setting up a new business.

## Business Startup
_Ethics:_ 
1. What are the ethical implications of funding for new start-ups?
2. How do businesses create value for stakeholders?

### GETCASH
* __Growth__: Capital growth of businesses
* __Earnings__
* __Transference and Inheritance__: For children
* __Autonomy__: Be your own boss
* __Security__: No-one can fire you 
* __Hobbies__: A business’s long-term plan to achieve goals and objectives.

### Steps for starting a business
2. __Plan__: (See Below)
3. __Legal Structure__: (See below) Determines ownership, organization, finances, etc. 
4. __Administrative:__ Take care of administrative tasks (i.e. Registering the company, statutes describing how its run, tax documentation, licenses). 
5. __Location:__ Home, incubators, etc, to begin business. 
6. __Hire:__ Some need to hire staff to start large amounts of work. 
7. __Financing:__ Personal savings to get started, more to continue (See Below). 

### Possible Problems:
* May over/underestimate financing needed. 
* Hard to break into established markets with strong competitors and loyal customer bases. 
* Hiring qualified personnel who prefer more stable incomes may be impossible unless ownership interest or other compensation is given. 
* Lack of management skill in dealing with problems, not wanting to cease control or bad financing may cause expensive problems. 

_insert business plan_

__The Business Plan__: A written tool for businesses, helps prepare for and prevent startup problems, and sets a basis for negotiations with banks, investors, etc, to obtain __capital investment__. It starts with a Business Idea. 

* __Product or Service?__ 
	* What is unique; Demand; Why there’s a market for it. 
* __Marketing: Who are the customers?__   
	* Business model; Consumer demographic; Scale; Competitors. 
* __Production: How to produce? What investments?__ 
	* Manual/Machinery; Capital Investment_ (used for at least a year_); Locale. 
* __Finance: How to pay for equipment and other costs?__
	* Capital Investment; Working Capital (day-to-day operations and inventory cost, not to be underestimated); Cash Flow (see below); Fundraising methods (see below). 
* __Human Resources: Do alone or who with?__
	* Help required (usually advanced stuff like legal issues, accounting)/not; Employees.

# 1.2 Organization Types

## Public Sector

* Usually government-owned organizations providing public goods and services (military; infrastructure; higher education—Universities). 
* Local governments focus on more specialized regions, usually only __break even__; Central governments may subsidize them from tax, as the services are essential. 

## Private Sector
* Organizations owned by individuals or groups of them, consist of most “businesses.” Primary goal to own profits to compensate owners and sustain the company after investment.

## For Profit Types (by Size ⬇)

__Sole Trader (Sole Proprietors/ships)__: 
* Individuals owning and running businesses alone, legally considered one entity. Full control and profits kept, but also responsible for all consequences. Employees have no ownership interest. 
* No-distinction between owner and business $\rightarrow$ Death/Incapacitation leads to uncertain future. Heirs/Family may dispute control if unspecified. 

__Partnerships__: 
* Created by two or more “partners.” Governed by partnership agreements, which dictate ownership interests, decision making control, consequence of 1+ partners’ incapacitation. 
* __Unlimited Liability__: (full legal responsibility that business owners and partners assume for all business debts). 
* UL is also especially a disadvantage when one partners have limited control over each other. Creditors usually come after partner with most personal assets. 
* Be careful when setting up! $
ightarrow$ Try to prevent UL and other issues.

__Corporations__: Large organizations owned by individuals and shareholders. A __share__ allows voting at general meetings and the receiving of profits through dividends. 
* Incorporation makes a business a separate legal entity, operating under __Limited Liability__. 
* Shareholders will only lose ownership interest or investment, and outside investors can be obtained as there is no extra risk. 
* Death of a shareholder does not impact function, and selling of shares generally has no major impact.
  * __Public Corporation__: Government owned 
  * __Private Limited Company__: Owned by few shareholders, usually families. May be hard for shareholders to sell shares and ‘cash out’. 
  * __Public Limited Company__: A PLC wishing to obtain more capital can ‘go public’ in an IPO (Initial Public Offering), which allows shares to be accessible to the public. However, they have to publish all financial information, including to competitors, and may run the risk of a __takeover__. 

## Non-Profit Sector
* Commitment to purpose, a mission, not profit (many wealthy individuals providing grants). Non-profits “own themselves (no owners)”. 
* University has no owners $\rightarrow$ accountable to themselves and education. 
* Funds gathered are used to run the institution and surplus is reinvested. Cumulative surplus is an __Endowment__ (a donation to nonprofit for investment in perpetuity), and interest earned on this contributes to the coverage of costs. 
* Most nonprofits run by a __Board of Directors__ responsible for recruiting senior staff. Accountable to third parties. If proof is given of social improvements, most nonprofits need not pay taxes. 
  * __NGO__: Nonprofit; Non-Governmental; Non-political; Human rights is not only focus; Non criminal. (i.e. Amnesty International, GreenPeace) 
  * __Charity__: Similar organization. In UK, it has tax advantages, and is for: Charitable purposes only, acting in public/social/environmental benefit. In US, mostly refers to organizations helping those in need.

# 1.3 Organizational Objectives/Attributes

## Mission/Vision Statement
__Vision__: A long term goal that an organization hopes to achieve in the future.

__Vision Statement__: Expresses above-mentioend vision to inspire everyone staff and employees, usually being somewhat idealistic/optimistic. 

__Mission Statement__: Complement vision statement by explaining the what the company is doing to achieve the vision, its role/purpose. 

* Critical during major turning points or decision making times, serving as a central reference point, but can evolve over time after series reflection. 
* Carefully worded and taken seriously by senior management, so employees take it to heart, and outside parties can understand it. 
* Organizations have come to collapse both into one for easier memorization or understanding. 

## Aims, objectives, strategies and tactics
_Survival $\rightarrow$ Growth & Scale $\rightarrow$ Profitability_

__Aims__: Broad/General goals an organization wishes to accomplish, probably vague and optimistic (mid-long term). 

__Objective__: Concrete, possibly shorter-term and more specific, measurable. Employees $\rightarrow$ Prioritize work, break down steps to larger objectives or ultimately the aim.
_Importance of A&Os vary from ownership, cultures, values, and can evolve based on market or employees/managers_

__Strategies__: Approach or plan formulated by an organization to achieve aims & objectives. _Can lead to prosperity or demise._ 
* TQM 
*  Ansoff Matrix
* ...

__Tactics__: Involves less important decisions and operate in shorter timeframes. Failure will be costly. 
_Strategies and Tactics can be different things for different organizations depending on size/resources_

## Ethical Objectives & CSR

__Business Ethics__: How professional individuals, groups, organization set decision making priorities. __Ethical Objectives__ are often set. 

### Corporate Social Responsibility

* Obligations to society and environment. Operate beyond observing basic regulations. 
* May be more expensive to be ethical (renewable price > oil price) $
ightarrow$ Value is significant
* Head start in long term profits and obstacle avoidance from future regulations (carbon tax…)
* _Triple Bottom Line_ Company’s results based on profit, people and planet results for evaluation. 
* _Shared Value_ Advantage of CSR to society and corporations. Ethical actions related to business objectives. (i.e. Nestle supports coffee growers and therefore ensures a sustainable supply of HQ beans).

__Policies and Purposes for CSR Objectives:__

$\rightarrow$ Labour Relations: 
*  Minimum standards for workers & fair treatment regardless of person.
* Economic protection and benefits and training.
* Develop & maintain a high-quality work force and attract talents. 
$\rightarrow$ Environment:
* Go beyond legal requirements for environment

$\rightarrow$ Community: 
* Support local communities and make donations. Encourage volunteering from employees. 
* Good CSR can improve marketing, publicity, and customer loyalty. 

$\rightarrow$ Supplier Relations: 
* Consider practices of suppliers and subcontractors. (If supplier is unethical, get out!). 

> CSR : Cadbury and Hershey building high QOL and lower expense communities for workers to improve their lives. Cadbury looking for cocoa sources that did not involve slave labour. Modern CSR after 1990s when Nike was pressured to create more acceptable factory conditions in Asia.   

Rising numbers of __Social Audits__/__Sustainability Reports__/etc review the impact of companies paying more attention to their role and consequences in society. 92% of 250 largest global corporations publish such reports.

# Stakeholders

[Stakeholder Interests](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/stakeholders/interests-of-external-stakeholders/)

* __Stakeholder__: _External_ or _Internal_ $\rightarrow$ individual/group affected by or affecting an organization. (≠ Stockholder, Shareholder). 
* __Observer Status__: A limited privilege granted by some organizations to non-members to give them an ability to participate in the organization’s activities. IGO $\rightarrow$ non-member states or INGOs. 

## Internal Stakeholders

* __Manager__ Runs the business $\rightarrow$ Aims/objectives $\rightarrow$ Create environment $\rightarrow$ Advance company and self (sensitive to reward, benefits, work condition, job security, and work content). 
	* Senior managers/CEO: Strategic direction
	* Middle managers: Carry out such
	* Junior managers (line/operating managers, supervisors, foremen) $\rightarrow$ Day to day operations.
* __Employee__: Individuals employed solely for work. (sensitive to reward, benefits, work condition, job security). Empowering them to contribute can improve collective outcomes. In a _knowledge economy_, many employees have professional expertise, so managerial-employee distinctions are thinning (similar interests). 
* __Shareholders__ (Primarily Corporate) Owners investing to receive returns (in dividends/ownership interest value (capital gain)) $\rightarrow$ concerned with profitability. Shareholders appoint a BoD which appoints a CEO to run in their interest. Some may consider them external, as they are not much involved in day-to-day operation.

## External Stakeholders (less direct influence)

* __Customers__: Purchase output, demand good service, quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Can be sensitive to company reputation and ethics.
* __Suppliers__: Individuals/businesses selling inputs to other organizations at what they deem reasonable costs. Wish for stable supply-demand business relationships to maintain market, and therefore for partner’s health and existence. 
* __Governments__: Regulate organizations in public interest and enforce laws for consequences. May depend on large companies for tax and employment opps, or are customers of defence/pharmaceutical/etc industries. 
* __Unions__: Protect employee livelihood and rights, representing them in firms and have more resources for defense. 
* __Banks__: Lend funds for operation, wish for loan return on time with interest, and so follow liquidity (availability of liquid assets), solvency (possession of liability-separate assets), and other health indicators. Companies may renegotiate payback schedules. 
* __The Society/Environment__: Affected by corporate behavior (CSR). If government fails public interest, ::Pressure Groups::: may come in to force ethical corporate behavior. Local communities are most directly impacted by company actions, in any manner. 
* __Competitors__: Organizations opposing a company’s success, but are impacted by its actions likewise. Competing organizations expect fairness in legal and ethical actions, but may also cooperate in mutual interest. (_IB may not consider them stakeholders_)


__Mutual benefit and conflict of stakeholder interests__:

[Examples](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/stakeholders/areas-of-mutual-benefit-and-conflict/)

* Most stakeholder groups have positive outcomes from a firm’s success, though they each limit the level of fulfilment of each other’s goals (low cost leads to lower profit). 
* Management $\rightarrow$ Reconcile competing stakeholder/shareholder interests, prioritizing more beneficial demands for company’s interest, and whether self serving parties are helpful.

# STEEPLE and External Environment

__Chapter Contents:__
* Better understand __opportunities__ and __threats__ instead of _SWOT_, especially when investing in new market strategies (determine whether to enter, or modify offerings when entering).
* Only useful when focused on specific businesses or lines of business (Disneyland rather than all Disney subsidiaries). 
* Including all relevant factors is more important than specifically categorizing them somewhere. 
* Companies need to constantly look out for changes in the external environment, so STEEPLE is not a one-time thing. Overlooking changes (especially threats) result in imperil the careers and the company’s future. Temporary company, or century spanning? 

## Sociocultural factors 

* The way people live; beliefs and values.
* Dominant and minority __Religions__, and their influence
* __Cuisine__ and dining habits. 
* __Family__ life, type and size.
* Demographics: fertility, life expectancy, services by age.
	*  __Pyramid of age__ (_insert pyramid of age_)
* __Health__ care and disease prevalence. 
* Formal __Education__ and basic education percentage. Gender equality. 

## Technological factors

* Rapid innovation in __information technology__ , and the blurring of the boundary between work and leisure. Software and devices have opened up new markets. 
* Availability of __big data__ to understand more about clients needs.
* __Nanotechnology__ in textiles and electronics; __genetic engineering__ in medical and agricultural science. __3d printing__; __AI__; __robotics__. 
* Availability of __infrastructure__ (transportation, sanitation…) especially in LEDC/MEDCs. Some countries are [leapfrogging](https://www.csis.org/analysis/need-leapfrog-strategy), going straight to more modern technologies from almost none. 

## Economic factors

* __Demand__ for products and services is different in each country, closely related to amount of discretionary income. Companies may change offerings or enter markets as living standards improve. 
* Countries experience alternating periods of fast and slow growth (_where income and unemployment may be problematic, and demand drops; when supply drops, prices increase, and sales drop_). __Macroeconomics__. 
* Depression may follow recession
* Business cycle: Change in GDP over time
* Companies may employ policies such as fiscal (taxes..) or monetary (interest…) measures to prevent slows. 
* __Recession__: refers to the case where GDP decreases for two or more quarters. 
* __Depression__: is used to describe a prolonged or particularly severe recession. There is no established criterion for defining depression in an economic context.

## Environmental factors

* __Quantity__ and __quality__ of usable fresh water, a constraint in business activity, especially for power and agriculture. 
* __Climate change__ altering worldwide weather patterns and impacting businesses. International climate change agreements will provide opportunities to some and restrictions on other. Companies each have a _carbon footprint_. 
* __Protection__ of species and habitats can limit development, although for example, for cosmetics, biodiversity can be a source of inspiration. 
* __Recycling__ or __disposal__ of growing solid waste accumulation, can also be costly or beneficial. __Air quality__$\rightarrow$ expensive pollution regulation compliance vs bad air quality consequences (relocation). car

## Political factors

* __Political regime__ (constitutional monarchy, dictatorship…) and stability of civil issues (regime change?). __Elections__ and new political parties? Business-political relationships? 

## Legal factors

* Abide by __laws__ and __regulations__ from central or local governments in home or operating countries. Look out for rules that can change business activities. Some companies higher _lobbyists_ to push for beneficial legislation.
* __Litigation__ (lawsuit) issues. Governments, other companies, employees, or consumers may sue business for unethical behavior or lack of responsibility and trustworthiness. Long processes may require arbitration (independent 3rd party settling). Potential for such complications and expensive settlements (going to billions) is a huge factor. 

## Ethical factors (CSR!)

* __Marketing__ of products that is unsuitable or not in consumer best interests (tobacco is not for teens; selling investment products not understood by investors). 
* __Unfair__ treatment and wages given to local (usually developing country) employees compared to those given in organization’s home countries. Especially for NGO. 
* __Unfair__ labour practices. [Zero-hour contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract)
* __Pricing policies__, ie. Ethical problems with discriminatory (_variant prices for same service/product based on customer agreement_) and predatory (_company with more resources lowers price to drive competition out of business_) pricing. Should drug companies lower prices for L/MEDCs?
* __Corruption__ extent in countries — measured by Corruption Perceptions Index (Transparency International). Buying votes, bribes, etc. International companies decide whether to engage with unethical countries and if so how to adapt policies. 

---

# Growth and Evolution

## Economy of Scale

* Structure and size of operations. Higher level of output can create lower production costs, and creates advantage over direct competitors. 
* Average unit cost of production decreases with output. 
* Such factors have initial costs, but total internal costs go down as output increases. 
* __Purchasing__: Lower input cost when purchasing in bulk. 
* __Technical__: Investment in good equipment results in eventual production cost reduction. Automation and efficiency at a certain extent reduces average fixed costs. 
* __Marketing__: Marketing campaigns and mediums for single output units are spread over larger and larger sales volumes. 
* __Managerial__: Revenue will allow hiring of more competitive and productive managers for each of the _business functions_ and in theory decrease costs by efficiency in expertise. 
__Financial__: Cost of capital decreases as larger corporations negotiate larger mutual trust—_as financing requirements grow_— borrowing deals. (Corporate bonds).

_External_: Existing infrastructure, skilled local labour force, good transport links, supportive legislation are good external factors for economies of scale. 

## Diseconomy of Scale

* Average unit cost of production increases with level of output, such as due to management issues with efficiency drop. 
* __Managerial__: Size of an enterprise has limits, and a smaller focused team on vision is more efficient. A CEO may have trouble coordinating huge masses of employees and divisions between them, unless most employees are low-skill hires (factory).  
* __Workforce size Increase__: Complex organizational hierarchies can increase wage expenses and overcrowding issues. Certain jobs may be highly isolated or specialized and lead to feelings of lack of involvement. 
* __Communication__: Complex structures may complicate communication, especially for multinational corporations. 

_External_: Growing industry sizes causing long average costs—traffic congestion, competition for scarce resources, high renting costs due to firm concentration, are external diseconomies of scale. 

## Small vs Large Companies

__Capital Requirements__: Some equipment and infrastructure investment-heavy industries require large companies. Others require minimal investment, and can be run by sole traders. 

__Economies of scale__: Organizations usually become larger with the potential of economies of scale, able to reduce supplier costs, and smaller ones may not have any competitive advantage. 

__Competition__: Larger organizations may provide better prices/services to customers, and can afford temporary losses to reduce competitors (predatory pricing). 

__Market__: Smaller organizations may be suited to niche markets with less customers, more custom products, and closer client ties. (i.e. Antique repairment). Standardized production suit large companies—computers that are used by millions. 

__Owner’s Objectives__: Businesses may wish to maximize profits, or simply to meet familial financial needs, as scaling (especially for sole traders), may not be worth the stress, or the inevitable loss of control. Some may not even hire or take loans. However, this does limit capital access. It may not always be possible to remain small and operate, as economies of scale in certain industries push large competitors to remove you from the equation. 

__Profit satisficing__: Behavior of business owners who choose not to grow their business because the existing enterprise meets their financial needs. 

---

## Internal and External Growth

Different growth types can be considered for different circumstances: 

__Timing__ (external fast), __Competition__ (acquisition of competitor), __Regulation__ (acquisition may be blocked due to monopoly threat), __Risk__ (internal is safer, also JV or strategic alliance), __Proprietary)__ (external is often hard to maintain privacy), __Culture__ (external growth may be hindered by cultural difference). 

### Internal Growth (_Organic Growth_)

Expansion carried out by organization alone (adding tables to restaurant), may take time, but there is control.

### External Growth

Involves other organizations. Promotes quick expansion and efficient meeting of objectives, and the gaining of expertise, though there may be significant risks, such as the exposure of proprietary information, culture clash, etc.

#### Mergers, acquisitions and takeovers

* __Mergers & Acquisitions__:  Result in fundamental structure of companies, and cannot easily be reversed, therefore are riskier. Can be larger/small operations. Large companies like Facebook acquiring companies like WhatsApp may not affect future if unsuccessful. Mergers of equals are especially risky, and 50% of mergers end in failure. Merging of companies may not create a unified entity, however ideal the strategic plan was, primarily due to company culture. It is AOL - Time Warner, conjoined, not unified.
* [Apparently Mergers of Equals don’t Exist?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2014/06/05/why-corporate-mergers-of-equals-almost-never-work/#502f56404176)
* __Merger__: Results in two firms combining to form one entity replacing both.  (A + B = AB). 
* __Acquisition__: One firm purchases another (50% or more of company B’s ownership interest, usually 100%). Parent company $\rightarrow$ Subsidiary relationship. Both exist as legal entities, but A controls B’s actions. Disney $\rightarrow$ Pixar. 
* __Takeover__: Takeovers can be 
 * __Hostile__ (_usually when in financial press releases_): senior managers of target film are in opposition (shareholders sell without consent). 
 * __Friendly__:  Management favors operation and recommends the sale of shares to acquiring company. Shares bought from shareholders at a price exceeding stock market value. Takeovers can lead to acquisitions or mergers.

#### Joint ventures

* Flexible, creates separate entity with equal investment from parties that can be dissolve at ends of projects at no compromise to businesses. (JVs). Share cost of and expertise for expensive business endeavor. 
* Used to reduce risk of developing costly assets and others. Many JVs end when the venture is purchased by one partner. Can be small projects (especially for startups) or major diversification purposes. 

#### Strategic alliances

* NO NEW ENTITY CREATED. Can be easily modified or terminated based on partnership and external environment. Alliances can be 2+ cooperations or result in development of closer working arrangements with JVs or mergers. (i.e. Airline Star Alliance, seamless service transfer even on international layovers)

### Globalization

__Trade barriers__: Are regulatory obstacles that limit trade between countries. Trade barriers include tariffs and quotas.

__Tariffs__: Are taxes that are placed on goods imported into a country.

__Quotas__: Are limits placed on the number or volume of goods that can be imported into a country.

__Trading blocs__: A variety of agreements entered into by countries in order to reduce barriers to trade between members. Examples include the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Mercosur in South America. 

## Franchising

[Table](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/growth-and-evolution/external-growth-franchising/)

* Arrangement between franchisor (company with successful business model who wants to expand) and franchisee. Franchisor can open outlets through internal growth, but finding partners who will do so may be advantageous and reduce risk. 
* Franchisees pay royalties and initial fees to buy the rights to use the name and business model of a franchisor, and must respect its practices and norms—little innovation room. They are supported by purchasing and marketing, training and good practices, legal advice and managerial software. Removes entrepreneurial risk —economies of scale. 
* Franchisee finances typically finance outlets alone, and keep most profit, and thus may have more motivation than employees of the franchisor. They also have local knowledge, which is good for international business. 
* Franchisor loses control of outlets, or direct access to customers, and a mistake can sometimes damage the larger company, and other franchisees. 
* Franchisees can be large organizations, who run multiple franchises of a larger corporation, or sole-traders. 

## Multinational Company (MNCs)

![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-27%20at%2010.31.10%20PM.jpg)

* OPERATIONS located internationally, at least one aside from home country. 
* Sometimes has a negative connotation, as many are accused fo bringing ills (pollution, obesity). 
* _Joke: they buy where prices are low, sell where prices are high, and avoid paying taxes everywhere_. 
* Many do not maintain ethical practices from home countries when working in developing regions, though public awareness is changing CSR value. 
* Size inevitably causes impact, good or bad, depending on purpose and behavior, as well as short-long term plans and host country’s regulations. 

__Positive Impact__:

* __Employment opportunities__ with the offering of better wages at least better than local employers and training— __transfer of skills and tech__ to local economy. 
* __Local businesses opportunities__—some business supply MCNs, such as farms, or see revenue increase as economy is stimulated. 
* __Infrastructure__ created by MCNs can benefit developing countries, such as clean water, or wastewater treatment for company use. __Consumer__ can also get more varieties of products. 
* Local governments earn __taxes and foreign currency__ from investment and sale of exported goods. 

__Negative impact__:

* Employment conditions may not be up to ethical standards and MCNs may have __limited commitment to local workforces__. Qualified jobs may be held by expatriates that can leave at any time bringing away expertise. 
* MCNs may care less about __pollution__ or environment protection, such as in mining, which can cause water shortages. 
* Demand of MCNs for local outputs can __increase prices__ which harms consumers or local businesses who want the same outputs. They’re strong competitors and can take business away from __local companies__ or make them disappear. Monopoly! Destabilization! Reliance!
