# 4.1 Role of Marketing

Marketing must work with each and every one of the business functions in order to develop the best and most optimal brand strategies: 

- **Human Resources Function**: A business must maintain the right quantity and quality of staff for marketing objectives. Recruitment and training must be coordinated with sales forecasts. Growth or loss of sales will also inherently induce recruitment or redundancy. 

- **Finance and Accounts Function**: Marketing activities will be constrained by budget, and thus ongoing back-and-forth with finance is necessary. Market research, advertising, and product design will incur further costs, but they won't guarantee success (repositioning products in the consumer's mind). Risks and values must be evaluated in this case. 

- **Operations Function**: Market research is pivotal in guiding R&D (Research and Development), and vice a versa, innovations will be sent to be marketed. Sales forecasts are useful to determine capacity to meet demand. 

## Market

1. A place for interation between buyers and sellers
	- Taobao
	- Mall
	- Stocks
2. A location
	- Country
	- City
	- Area
3. A type of product
	- Food
	- Technology
	- Toys
4. Mix of 2/3, (i.e. Arctic Banana Juice Market)

## Market Characteristics

- Product life cycle
- Boston consulting group matrix
- STEEPLE
- SWOT
- Ansoff matrix

## Marketing of Goods & Services

Use Marketing Mix: Product, price, promotion, place, as tools to meet demands.

All four elements must meet customer needs, high quality, and appropriate pricing (gum shouldn't be high priced and won't be considered "cheap" or "bad"). Advertising campaigns will be carried out in the right locations. 

However, there are differences when dealing with goods or services. Goods emphasize packaging, while services' quality must align with price. Services which include tangible aspects such as hotels with food must also deal with aesthetics.  

### Services Marketing Mix
Three more marketing mix elements are added to help:

- People
- Processes
- Physical Evidence
(Chapter 4.6)

Services must be wary of physical evidences which convey their quality. A good Internet Service Provider (ISP; ChinaNet, AT&T...) might provide nice routers for you. 

### Blend
The above concepts are important because many business operate with a mix of both goods and services. Music is a good example, concerts and online livestreams are services, while albums and physical souvenirs are goods. 

## Product and Market Orientation
*Product development; R&D*

### Product Orientation
Companies will prioritise R&D over market research—inward facing. Examples include Apple, who have faith in their team to come up with new ideas which can be marketed later on, for example, entering new markets or *creating* demand.

This focus can create ground-breaking developments, which can be patented, and used as a Unique Selling Point (USP). For example, KPOP bands have a USP of vocals, rapping, dancing, all in one, which is rare in the west.

However, there are cases where investment does not need to good sales, for example, Concorde, a supersonic jet that could cross the Atlantic under 4 hours, but was so expensive only 14 planes were sold. 

**Advantages**
- Innovative products; Patents
- USP
- High quality product
- Investment in technology
- Little competition
- Economies of scale

**Disadvantages**
- No guarantee of sales
- R&D is expensive
- May miss other opportunities
- Narrow branding
- Obsoletion risk

### Market Orientation
Needs of the customer > Everything else. 

Extensive continuous market research will guide decision-making, providing more guarantee for acceptance. Most successful companies do this. Coca-Cola has 500+ brands, and Amazon personalizes shopping. 

However, market research is open, and thus competitors can do the same. It may become harder to create a USP, and competition will lower profit and market share. Market research done wrong is also devastating.

**Advantages**
- Products likely to conform to needs
- Results in more focused production/strategy
- Quality of marketing activities is improved as needs are researced
- Repeat customers $\rightarrow$ Long-term profitability. 

**Disadvantages**
- Less unique products
- More competition
- All depends on market research
- Market changes quickly, adapatation is challenging
- Risk of underestimating customers

## Social Marketing
*not to be confused with "social media marketing"*

Aims to influence societal behavior in a beneficial way, such as to induce the habit of recycling. The process is similar to commercial marketing. *Objective--target--marketing mix--control tools*. 

However, there are indeed differences with commercial marketing, especially with objectives and tools. 

### Marketing Objectives

**Social Marketing**
*Changing Behavior*

- Environment, public health, vaccinations, smoking/alcohol/drugs, anti-social

Governments spend a significant portion of taxes on advertising campaigns to improve quality of life and public facilities. 

**Commercial Marketing**
*Meeting Needs*

- Increasing market share, brand recognition/loyalty

Advertising campaigns are expensive and should achieve the above to be successful, raising sales. Rebranding products for different markets is often a good strategy. 

### Control Tools
> "Half the money I spent on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half" 
> --John Wanamaker

**Social Marketing**

It is hard to evaluate success, but we can look at related statistics. For example, public health campaigns might look for reduction in bad behavior over an *extensive* period (for there to be noticeable effects). 

We must also beware of other factors which may have caused such changes, which may form a larger picture. Trying to quantify some changes, such as reduction in emissions, may also be difficult given its numerous sources and checkpoints. 

## Market Share & Leadership

### Market Share

Measures value of sales compared to the whole market, being careful of market definition and time periods. 

Market Share(%) $= \frac{\textrm{Product Sales}}{\textrm{Total Market Sales}}\cdot 100$

Can also look at volume; Quantity of items rather than value. Can be used in conjunction with value share as there may be a relationship between user proportion and revenue—smartphone brand users and respective brand values.

Market Share(%) $= \frac{\textrm{No. Units sold by firm}}{\textrm{Total volume sold in market}} \cdot 100$

### Market Leadership

The brand/company with the highest market share will easily gain recognition due to its market presence. 

**Adantages**:
- Ease of access to distribution channels
- Brand recognition
- Economies of scale
- Price leadership

**Distribution**
Retailers will stock in-demand products, with the variety decreasing for smaller retailers. For example, smaller convenience stores in China might only sell Coke, and not Pepsi, given its popularity in China. This will induce a positive feedback loop where a high market share supports strong sales.   

**Brand Recognition**
Market leaders will likely have high brand recognition, improving sales. Some brands are successful to the point of "becoming" their category (i.e. Photoshopping, Googling).As consumers understand the brand's message and product range, it will always be considered.

**Economies of Scale (Ch. 1.6)**
Refer to cost savings which come from a large number of products—market leader enjoys lower total cost. This can be because they are allowed to buy in bulk, and have experienced managers. Expensive capital equipment will also be made up for by a high output $\rightarrow$ *price leadership.*

**Price Leadership**
Leaders can lower prices to gain more market share or maintain them to increase profit, even when competitors have to raise. Competitors will have to react and try to analyze the leader's strategy. Leaders can gain a lot of control, and their pricings may be considered industry standard–a problem for competitors if they cannot afford it. 

## Marketing Objectives.
Marketing objectives help the function stay on course and accountable, and they must be inline with corporate objectives. Often, they are set through the SMART format. 

- **S**—Specific
- **M**–Measurable
- **A**—Attainable
- **R**—Realistic
- **T**—Time Focused

### For-Profit Organizations
*Sole traders, partnerships, companies, cooperatives, microfinance providers, public-private partnership*

Objective types are selected based on factors such as management style. A confident manager might set ambitious and challenging targets. 

Other factors may include national culture (Geert Hofsteded's Cultural Dimensions). For example, as mentioned in previous chapters, Japanese companies are more likely to set long-term objectives than American ones.  

**Examples (By Type):**
- Gain 25% market share in 2 years *(Market Share)*
- At least 20% of sales come from repeat customers *(Brand Loyalty)*
- At least 50% of the target market can name our brand in surveys *(Brand Recognition)*

### Non-Profit Organizations
*Charities, NGOs*

Objectives are for enriching society, rather than the company itself. Such organizations vary greatly in size and field, leading to different objectives. Anti-bullying charities might look to promote measures, while Covid-19 charities might look to raise funds for donations. 

**Examples (By Type):**
- Raise at least RMB 1,000,000 *(Fundraising)*
- 30% reduction in teenage smoking by 2022 *(Changinb behavior)*
- Achieve at least 51% awareness of ivy trafficking *(Improving awareness)*

## Evolution of Marketing Strategies
Marketing strategies must constantly evolve through market research and be in-sync with the external environment. It can b affected by: 

**Changing Customer Preferences**
Fashion, technology, culture, and economy are all major factors in changing consumer demands. Retailers, for example, must always stay on top of trends. H&M aims to have *"new clothes coming into store almost everyday"*

**Innovation**
Innovation in the 21st century is blazing fast. Many product oriented companies, for example, push out new products in very short times. Product life cycles in mature markets are shortened, and even successful products may find themselves becoming obsolete within months (See iPod vs Zune).

**Ethical Considerations**
*Decisions and actions governed by morality*

Ethical standards are subjective and subject to constant change. They are also unique to cultures or consumer groups. Upholding these standards can lead to USPs, in turn generating revenue and loyalty. For example:

- Selling environmentally friendly ('green') products
		- Tesla Motors: Electric Battery Cars—Lowered carbon emissions. 
- Ethical treatment of workers 
		- Offering good working conditions and pay—improve brand image and employee motivation.  
- Ethical treatment of suppliers and ethical sourcing
		- Retailers may pressure suppliers to reduce operating costs, often by mistreatment of workers. 
		- Source materials may also come from unethical processes, such as Cobalt from African child labor used in smartphones. 
		- See "Fair Trade"

**Cultural Differences**
In a world where globalization proliferates, multinational corporations target a diverse range of markets all around the world. Marketing adequately in different geographical regions calls for a good cultural understanding. 

# 4.2 Marketing Planning

A _marketing plan_ is a document that outlines the entire marketing process.
It starts with objectives, then the target market, marketing mix, and control tools.
This subtopics talks about how to make and use marketing plans.
Correct use of marketing plans will increase a company's chance of achieving their marketing objectives.

## Elements of a Marketing Plan

The main elements of a marketing plan includes:
- Marketing objective
- Marketing budget
- Segmentation and target market
- Market research
- Marketing strategies
- Control tools

#### Marketing Objective

The company's marketing goal.
Should help towards the company's corporate objective.

#### Marketing Budget

Money allocated to marketing.
There are three major methods of marketing:

- __Objective based__: estimate based on objective
- __Sales based:__ fixed percentage of sales revenue
- __Incremental based:__ based on last year's budget, normally increases every year

Objective based is the most flexible, but hardest to get correct.

#### Segmentation and Target Market

Marketing segmentation breaks consumers into groups with similar characteristics and needs.
This is like categorizing customers by special traits.
These traits vary across businesses types.
For example, a gym might segment their market based on the fitness of their customers.

#### Marketing Research

Marketing research is the act of gathering information about the needs of consumers.
There can be their habits, tastes, needs, and more.
Effective market research allows companies to find new opportunities that they can take advantage of.

#### Marketing Strategy

Marketing strategies are long term actions that can achieve the marketing objective.
These are guided by the marketing mix.

#### Control Tools

Control tools are used to determine if the marketing strategy is successful.
Is is done by gathering data (both qualitative and quantitative), which are then compared with parameters.
Some common places which data can be gathered from are:

- sales figures
- customer retention rates
- customer perception surveys and focus groups
- market analysis reports

### The Role of Marketing Planning

Marketing plans should allow managers to create a coherent marketing strategy.
While marketing plans are useful, they also have limitations. 
Time and resources are required to create proper marketing plans.
Smaller companies may not have the resources to create effective marketing plans.

Marketing plans should only be seen as a guide.
Often, the market changes.
The marketing plan should be readjusted accordingly.

### The Marketing Cycle

- Marketing objectives set
- Target market identified
- Market research carried out
- Marketing strategies developed and implemented

## The Four P's

This section is a brief introduction to the Four P's. 
Refer to 4.5 for more detailed information.

The marketing mix is formed by the Four P's.

1. Product
2. Price
3. Promotion
4. Place

### Product
- Sourcing from ethical companies

Products are broken down into good and services.
Goods are things that can be physically interacted with (buying a movie DVD).
Services are things done for you, that you cannot touch (watching a movie at a theater).
The design, features, colors, sizes, of goods, and the quality of the services are focused on in the product range.

### Pricing

The cost of a product will largely influence if customers are willing to pay.
This is effected by internal and external factors, such as the cost of production and the prices of competitors.

### Promotion

Promotion can be above-the-line or below-the-line.
Above the line promotion is advertising broadly through media.
While below the line tactics is advertising in a more personal manner.
The method of promotion largely varies by the marketing objectives and the marketing budget.

### Place

The method of distributing a product is influential on how well it sells.
The choice from whether to use distributors, or where the physical retail stores are located, to online retailers is determined here.

## Adjusting the Marketing Mix

Different organizations have different goals, and the marketing mix should be adjusted accordingly.



# 4.3 Sales Forecasting

Sales forecasting is used by companies to predict future sales levels, and it is highly beneficial when accurate. Sufficient preparations can be made in advanced in response. 

## Trend Analysis

Patterns in time-series (statistics over time) data are analyzed for predictions. These trends are helpful for:

- Understanding the rise and fall of sales. 
- Seasonal changes (especially for seasonal businesses like hotels). 
- Cyclical fluctuations, as a result of economic growth or decline (2008 Financial Crises). 
- Pinpointing random or sporadic fluctuations which are less worrisome or unsolvable. 

Let's say a 

# 4.4 Market Research

## 4 P of Market Research

Market research is an essential tool that allow companies to stay up to date with their customers, competitors, and stakeholders. Without proper market research, businesses can run into a lot of issues, for example, selling products that no one wants.

Market research can be split into four major areas, or the _four P's_.

- Product
- Price
- Promotion
- Place

### Product

Product based research is a method of research done by testing products on potential customers. This allows companies to understand customer's reaction before releasing a product to the market.

This type of research is comprehensive. Sometimes companies can decide whether to launch a product based on information gathered from product based research.

### Price

Price based research is research done on the pricing of products. This can involve finding out the pricing of competing products or what customers are willing to pay for. This type of research decides the pricing of products.

### Promotion

Promotion based research deals with allowing companies to understand the avenues of marketing. Whether it is social media or a simple newspaper, companies have to discover which media types are accessed by their target audience.

This research can sometimes link to finding out more about the target audience. This can be done either by primary research, or buying customer profiles from companies that focus on conducting market research. 

### Place

Place based research is responsible for finding out the method of distribution of a product. Companies research into which physical (and digital) locations can contribute to the sales of the product. Often, valuable information can be gathered by simplify asking the target market.
