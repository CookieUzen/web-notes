# Describing Fields:

## Essential idea: 
Electric charges and masses each influence the space around them and that influence can be represented through the concept of fields.​

## Nature of science:  
Paradigm shift: The move from direct, observable actions being responsible for influence on an object to acceptance of a field’s “action at a distance” required a paradigm shift in the world of science.

## Understandings: ​

• Gravitational fields ​

• Electrostatic fields ​

• Electric potential and gravitational potential ​

• Field lines ​

• Equipotential surfaces ​

## Applications and skills: ​

• Representing sources of mass and charge, lines of electric and gravitational force, and field patterns using an appropriate symbolism ​

• Mapping fields using potential ​

• Describing the connection between equipotential surfaces and field lines

## Guidance: ​

• Electrostatic fields are restricted to the radial fields around point or spherical charges, the field between two point charges and the uniform fields between charged parallel plates ​

• Gravitational fields are restricted to the radial fields around point or spherical masses and the (assumed) uniform field close to the surface of massive celestial bodies and planetary bodies ​

• Students should recognize that no work is done in moving charge or mass on an equipotential surface 

## Fields

A field is said to exist when one object can exert a force on another
object at a distance.

A gravitational field is associate with a mass. Every mass has its own
gravitational field. A gravitational field only attracts, there is no
repulsive gravitational field.

The gravitational field strength of an mass is $g$, or acceleration due
to gravity.

## Field Lines

Field lines help visualize and fields. Field lines show the direction of
the force due to a field.

Equipotential lines are drawn to represent where the potential of a
field is always the same. In a gravitational field line diagram,
equipotential lines are farther apart from each other the farther the
lines are from the center.

# 10.2 Fields at Work

## Essential idea: 
Similar approaches can be taken in analyzing electrical and gravitational potential problems.​

## Nature of science: 
Communication of scientific explanations: The ability to apply field theory to the unobservable (charges) and the massively scaled (motion of satellites) required scientists to develop new ways to investigate, analyze and report findings to a general public used to scientific discoveries based on tangible and discernible evidence.

## Understandings: ​

• Potential and potential energy ​

• Potential gradient ​

• Potential difference ​

• Escape speed ​

• Orbital motion, orbital speed and orbital energy ​

• Forces and inverse-square law behavior 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Determining the potential energy of a point mass and the potential energy of a point charge ​

• Solving problems involving potential energy ​

• Determining the potential inside a charged sphere ​

• Solving problems involving the speed required for an object to go into orbit around a planet and for an object to escape the gravitational field of a planet ​

• Solving problems involving orbital energy of charged particles in circular orbital motion and masses in circular orbital motion ​

• Solving problems involving forces on charges and masses in radial and uniform fields

## Guidance: ​

• Orbital motion of a satellite around a planet is restricted to a consideration of circular orbits (links to 6.1 and 6.2) ​

• Both uniform and radial fields need to be considered ​

• Students should recognize that lines of force can be two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional fields ​

• Students should assume that the electric field everywhere between parallel plates is uniform with edge effects occurring beyond the limits of the plates.

## Gravitational Potential

Gravitational potential difference is the work done in moving a unit
mass between two points. Gravitational potential is the work done in
moving a unit mass infinitely far away to a certain point. The equation
for gravitational potential is: $$V_g = -\frac{GM}{r}$$

Gravitational potential is always negative because the closer an object
is to another object, the more work has been done to move the object
from infinite distance, and thus the more work we will have to do to put
it back.

## Gravitational Potential Energy

Similar to gravitational potential, gravitational potential energy is
the energy required to move a mass from infinite far away to a certain
point. $$GPE = \frac{GMm}{r}$$

## Escaping the Earth

The total energy of a satellite is made up of its kinetic and
gravitational potential energy. In order for a satellite to escape a
planet's gravitational field, the object will have to convert all of its
potential energy into kinetic energy. $$\begin{aligned}
    \Delta-\frac{GMm}{r} &= \Delta\frac{1}{2}mv^2\end{aligned}$$
Simplify this equation to find the escape velocity, which is
$\sqrt{2gr}$.
