## 7.1 Discrete Energy and Radioactivity

## Essential idea: 
In the microscopic world energy is discrete.​

## Nature of science:  
Accidental discovery: Radioactivity was discovered by accident when Becquerel developed photographic film that had accidentally been exposed to radiation from radioactive rocks. The marks on the photographic film seen by Becquerel probably would not lead to anything further for most people. What Becquerel did was to correlate the presence of the marks with the presence of the radioactive rocks and investigate the situation further. 

## Understandings: ​
-Discrete energy and discrete energy levels ​
-Transitions between energy levels ​
-Radioactive decay ​
-Fundamental forces and their properties ​
-Alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays ​
-Half-life ​
-Absorption characteristics of decay particles ​
-Isotopes ​
-Background radiation 

## Guidance: ​
-Students will be required to solve problems on radioactive decay involving only integral numbers of half-lives ​
-Students will be expected to include the neutrino and antineutrino in beta decay equations 

# 7.2 Nuclear Reactions:

## Essential idea: 
Energy can be released in nuclear decays and reactions as a result of the relationship between mass and energy.​

## Nature of science:  
Patterns, trends and discrepancies: Graphs of binding energy per nucleon and of neutron number versus proton number reveal unmistakable patterns. This allows scientists to make predictions of isotope characteristics based on these graphs.

- Nuclear Fusion
- Nuclear Fission
- Transmutation (Artificial/Induced or Natural)

## Understandings: ​
-The unified atomic mass unit ​
-Mass defect and nuclear binding energy ​
-Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion ​

## Applications and skills: ​
-Solving problems involving mass defect and binding energy ​
-Solving problems involving the energy released in radioactive decay, nuclear fission and fusion ​
-Sketching and interpreting the general shape of the curve of average binding energy per nucleon against nucleon number


In a nuclear equation:

- Conservation of *nucleons*: Nucleon number must tally up on both sides
- Conservation of *charge*: Total charge must be equal on both sides.

Binding energy, binding energy per nucleon!!!!

# 7.3 The Structure of Matters:
## Essential idea: 
It is believed that all the matter around us is made up of fundamental particles called quarks and leptons. It is known that matter has a hierarchical structure with quarks making up nucleons, nucleons making up nuclei, nuclei and electrons making up atoms and atoms making up molecules. In this hierarchical structure, the smallest scale is seen for quarks and leptons (10-18 m).

## Nature of science: 
(1) Predictions: Our present understanding of matter is called the standard model, consisting of six quarks and six leptons. Quarks were postulated on a completely mathematical basis in order to explain patterns in properties of particles. (2) Collaboration: It was much later that large-scale collaborative experimentation led to the discovery of the predicted fundamental particles.

## Understandings: ​
• Quarks, leptons and their antiparticles ​

• Hadrons, baryons and mesons ​

• The conservation laws of charge, baryon number, lepton number and strangeness ​

• The nature and range of the strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force and electromagnetic force ​

• Exchange particles ​

• Feynman diagrams ​

• Confinement ​

• The Higgs boson 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Describing the Rutherford-Geiger-Marsden experiment that led to the discovery of the nucleus ​

• Applying conservation laws in particle reactions ​

• Describing protons and neutrons in terms of quarks ​

• Comparing the interaction strengths of the fundamental forces, including gravity ​

• Describing the mediation of the fundamental forces through exchange particles ​

• Sketching and interpreting simple Feynman diagrams ​

• Describing why free quarks are not observed
