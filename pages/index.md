# Welcome to Web Notes!

This is a IBDP general notes platform for all HL and SL Students! This is a CAS project from : 

- Cobbi Liu
- Uzen Huang

**Core Contributor**
- Alex Xue

## Purpose

Web-notes (please suggest a better name) is not just a CAS project, its a lifestyle. Although the age of handwritten notes has not ended, it is increasingly important to have a digital knowledge base for all your educational needs. As this site grows, you will see resources for all the major IB subjects (both HL and SL), as well as a IB guide and productivity blog. We hope this will be beneficial to you in your DP journey, or your pre-DP preparation process. 

*DP1s please join us in the future for a great CAS experience, and when we think you're ready, it can become your CAS project as well!*

## Vision
We want to create an interactive online "Utopia" for IB students, and in the future, those of other curriculumns as well. We hope that this site can develop into something great minds can contribute to and students of all ages and backgrounds can learn from, while being a platform for the ideas of the future.
