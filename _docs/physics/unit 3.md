# Temperature and Energy Transfer

Temperature is the average internal kinetic energy of an object. The SI
Unit of temperature in Kelvins ($K$). However, Celsius is sometimes
used. $$K = C + 273$$

In general, temperature will aways attempt to reach thermal equilibrium.
Meaning that objects will aways try to reach the same temperature over
time.

A temperature of $0 K$ is called absolute temperature. This is when the
internal energy of a mas is zero.

## Internal Energy

Substances consist of particles in constant random motion. The internal
energy of a molecule is the total potential and random kinetic energy of
all the particles in a substance.

## Specific Heat Capacity

The Specific Heat Capacity is defined as the amount of energy needed to
raise a unit mass of an object by one Kelvin. This equation models the
relationship between change in temperature and energy.
$$Q = mc\Delta T$$ Where $Q$ is the energy required, $m$ is the mass,
$c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $\Delta T$ is the change in
temperature.

## Specific Latent Heat

Latent heat is the amount of energy required to shift an object from one
state to another. This equation models the relationship between latent
heat and energy. $$Q = mL$$ Where $Q$ is the energy required, $m$ is the
mass, and $L$ is the latent heat.

Latent heat of fusion is the energy require to change the phase from
liquid to solid of 1kg of substance. Latent heat of vaporization is the
energy required to change the phase of 1kg of liquid into a gas.

# Modeling a gas

## Mole and the Avogadro Constant

The mole is used for measuring the amount of substance. A mol of gas
contains $6.02 \cdot 10^23$ atoms. This is also the Avogadro constant.

## Molar Mass

The molar mass of an substance is the mass of one mol of said substance.
$$\textrm{Mass of substance} = \textrm{Substance Molar Mass} \times \textrm{Mols of Substance}$$

## Ideal Gas Law

The Ideal Gas Law sum up the relationship between pressure, volume,
temperature, and moles of molecules of a gas. $$pV = nRT$$ Where $p$ is
pressure (SI Unit is Pascals or $Pa$), $V$ is volume, $n$ moles of
molecule (SI Unit in moles or Mol), $R$ is the ideal gas constant
($8.3145 \cdot 10^3$), and $T$ is the temperature (in Kelvins).

## Assumptions of an Ideal Gas

-   A gas consist of many tiny molecules in random motion

-   Each molecule has negligible volume when compared with the volume of
    the gas

-   Molecules undergo perfectly elastic collisions

-   There is no intermolecular force, the energy of the molecules is
    only kinetic

-   The duration of a collision is negligible compared with the time
    between the collisions

-   Forces of individual molecules with average out to an uniformed
    pressure

## Total Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas

The total internal energy of an ideal gas is the sum of the average
random kinetic energy of each particle inside the gas.
$$\sum KE = \frac{3}{2} N k_B T$$ Where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann Constant,
$N$ is the amount of particles, and $T$ is the temperature.

Note, the internal energy of each individual particle is the equation
above without $N$. $$KE = \frac{3}{2} k_B T$$

## Real Gases

Ideal gas is ideas. Ideal gases cannot be liquefied. Thus, as a gas near
high pressure or low temperatures, it may behave like a real gas instead
of an ideal gas. A real gas is a non idea gas.
