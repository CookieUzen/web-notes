# 12.1 The Interaction of Matter with Radiation

## Essential Idea

The microscopic quantum world offers a range of phenomena whose interpretation and explanation reuire new ideas and concepts not found in the classical world

## Nature of Science

Observations: Much of the work towards a quantum theory of atoms was guided by the need to explain the observed patterns in atomic spectra. The first quantum model of matter is the Bohr model for hydrogen

Paradigm shift: The acceptance of the wave-particle duality paradox for light and particles required scientists in many fields to view research from new perspectives

## Understandings:
-Photons
-The photoelectric effect
-Matter waves
-Pair production and pair annihilation 
-Quantization of angular momentum in the Bohr model for hydrogen
-The wave function
-The uncertainty principle for energy and time and position and momentum
-Tunneling, potential barrier and factors affecting funneling probability

## Applications and skills:
-Discussing the photoelectric effect and explaining which features of the experiment cannot be explained by the classical wave theory of light 
-Solving photoelectric problems both graphically and algebraically
-Discussing experimental evidence for matter waves, including an experiment in which the wave nature of electron is evident
-Starting order of magnitude estimates from the undertainty principle

## Guidance:
-The order of magnitude estimates from the uncertainty principle may include estimates of the energy of the ground state of an atom, the impossibility of an electron existing within a nucleus, and the lifetime of an electron in an excited energy state
-Tunneling is to be treated qualitatively using the idea of continuity of wave functions
