# 4.1 Role of Marketing

Marketing must work with each and every one of the business functions in order to develop the best and most optimal brand strategies: 

- **Human Resources Function**: A business must maintain the right quantity and quality of staff for marketing objectives. Recruitment and training must be coordinated with sales forecasts. Growth or loss of sales will also inherently induce recruitment or redundancy. 

- **Finance and Accounts Function**: Marketing activities will be constrained by budget, and thus ongoing back-and-forth with finance is necessary. Market research, advertising, and product design will incur further costs, but they won't guarantee success (repositioning products in the consumer's mind). Risks and values must be evaluated in this case. 

- **Operations Function**: Market research is pivotal in guiding R&D (Research and Development), and vice a versa, innovations will be sent to be marketed. Sales forecasts are useful to determine capacity to meet demand.

## 4 P of Market Research

Market research is an essential tool that allow companies to stay up to date with their customers, competitors, and stakeholders. Without proper market research, businesses can run into a lot of issues, for example, selling products that no one wants.

Market research can be split into four major areas, or the _four Ps_.

- Product
- Price
- Promotion
- Place

### Product

Product based research is a method of research done by testing products on potential customers. This allows companies to understand customer's reaction before releasing a product to the market.

This type of research is comprehensive. Sometimes companies can decide whether to launch a product based on information gathered from product based research.

### Price

Price based research is research done on the pricing of products. This can involve finding out the pricing of competing products or what customers are willing to pay for. This type of research decides the pricing of products.

### Promotion

Promotion based research deals with allowing companies to understand the avenues of marketing. Whether it is social media or a simple newspaper, companies have to discover which media types are accessed by their target audience.

This research can sometimes link to finding out more about the target audience. This can be done either by primary research, or buying customer profiles from companies that focus on conducting market research. 

### Place

Place based research is responsible for finding out the method of distribution of a product. Companies research into which physical (and digital) locations can contribute to the sales of the product. Often, valuable information can be gathered by simplify asking the target market.
