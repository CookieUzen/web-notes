## Physical Quantities and Calculations

When plugging in quantities into an equation, always be aware of unit
conversion. A method to avoid calculation error with unit conversion is
to treat the units as mathematical entities. This is called quantity
calculus.

## Scientific Notation

Scientific Notation leaves only one digit, and concatenate the rest as
powers of ten. For example: $4.82 \cdot 10^4$. The decimal places
indicates how many digits of significant figures is the number accurate
to.

### SI Prefix

A common list of SI Prefixes can be found below:

 Factor    Name    Symbol     Factor     Name    Symbol
--------- ------- -------- ------------ ------- --------
 $10^1$    deca     $da$    $10^{-1}$    deci     $d$

 $10^24$   yotta    $Y$     $10^{-24}$   yocto    $y$

### Significant Figures

Significant Figures determines the amount of digits that is accurate in
a certain calculation. To find the significant figure of a number, we
use the following rules:

-   Left most *non-zero* digit is the `most significant digit`

-   If there is no decimal points, the rightmost digit *non zero* digit
    is the `least significant digit`

-   If there is a decimal point, the rightmost digit is the
    `least significant digit`

-   All digits between the `most significant digit` and the
    `least significant digit` is significant.

When doing a calculation, always round to the smallest significant
figure. When rounding, round up with numbers above and including 5, and
down with numbers below 5.

## Uncertainties and Error

In physics, there will always be issues with uncertainty and errors. It
is important to take these into account when doing calculations with the
data.

# Vectors and Scalers

Physical quantities can be grouped into two different categories,
scalers and vectors.

## Define Scalers and Vectors

**Scalers** are unit of measurement that only describe the magnitude of
an object. For example, distance is a scaler: it only describe how far
you went.

**Vectors** are a unit of measurement that describe both the magnitude
and a direction. For example, displacement is a vector. It describe the
direction of movement and the distance traveled.

Below is a list of common scalers and vectors:

       Scaler                  Vector
--------------------- -------------------------
        speed                 velocity
      distance              displacement
 energy, work, power        acceleration
     temperature                force
      pressure                momentum
        mass                   impulse
       volume          electric field strength

## Working with Vectors

We tend to break vectors into the x direction and the y direction. This
way, we can represent the vectors with positive and negative values. For
example, a force applied on a object upwards can be indicated with a
positive sign, and a downwards force represented by a negative sign.

To separate the X and Y direction, we usually use trig function (sin cos
tan).
