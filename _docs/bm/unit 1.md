## Basics
_Business_
Human Resources -> Finance and accounts -> Marketing (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) -> Market -> Operations
_Inputs_
Physical/Financial/Human Resources -> AKA Factors of Production: 
__Land | Labour | Capital | Enterprise__
_Processes::  — *Value added*:
Manufacturing, food processing, construction, etc. 
_Outputs_
Goods/Services
_Sectoral Change_ 
- [ ] A shift in relative share of national output and employment that is attributed to each business sector over time.  
_Structural Change_ Dramatic shift in way an industry/market functions -> Usually by major economic developments. 
[[/Table of Contents]]

# Role of Businesses (Can help and harm society)
- *Exist to create value worth more than inputs, those who do will thrive and prosper*
- *Demand for a business’s goods/services allows for profit for better operations and future investment*
- *If a business’s output value is lower than that of the input, it can “destroy value,” and lead to its failure; Inefficient input processing*
- *Non-profit/Gov organizations may “seem” to be less constrained by the market and value-adding obligations. Somewhat an illusion.*
- __Capitalism__ -> forces inefficient organizations to shut, and better organizations can use the freed resources to improve. 

# Inputs and Output
__Input: Resources Used__
_Physical Resources_ Raw materials and semi-finished (not ready for sale; Electronics, machines)  goods purchased to begin production -> Agriculture, lumber, oil, etc. __LAND__.
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-07%20at%2011.24.20%20PM.jpg)
_Financial Resources_Funds needed to setup and invest in a business for it to run. Longer-term financing used to maintain locales, and capital equipment (desks). Shorter-term financing is used to pay for inputs (inventory) and ongoing expenses (salaries). __CAPITAL__.
_Human Resources_People running the business, from managers to employees. __LABOUR__.
	- _Enterprise:: -> Entrepreneurs take risks: establish and 	drive business forward with other inputs. __ENTERPRISE__.

__Outputs: Goods/Services__
_Goods_ Tangible products with measurable characteristics (food, phones). 
_Services_Intangible or not described physical properties. Actions provided by people or algorithms. 
- Sometimes go hand in hand (restaurant meal pays for the food, and the services by which the food was made).*
_B2B_Business to Consumer: Common, product/service and consumer. 
_B2B_Business to Business: Business with other for-profit business. 
_C2C_Customer to Customer: Consumer sells used product or diy product to other consumer. 
_C2B_Consumer to Business: Consumer/End User sells service/product to businesses (Youtuber ad-spaces, freelance).

## Business Functions (Mutually dependent, departments created as businesses expand)
*Marketing (Changes determined) -> Operations (Cost changes in production) -> F&A (How much finance required) -> HR (New workers needed? How?)*
_Human Resources_ Function that strategically ensures appropriate number of adequately skilled employees are gathered. 
Also -> Compensation, induction, training, termination. Oversee that employee treatment complies with business operation laws. _Knowledge Economy:: growth makes employees’ collective skill a  great percentage of company’s value. 
_Finance and Accounts_ (AKA: Accounting, Finance, Bookkeeping). Ensure business has sufficient funds for activities. 
Also -> Maintaining records, forecasting financial information, paying creditors, assist in determining pricing strategies for profit, evaluate profitability of projects. 
_Marketing_ Marketing process -> Promotion -> Advertising (just one part).  Determining product release timing and pricing to the right customers. Consider promotion methods. Determine Wants and needs of segments (customer groups) in market. 
_Operations_ (AKA: Production). Improves efficiency of core business activity(s) to be conducted, manages it. 
Also -> Plan how goods/services are produced and in what quantities. How to deliver in lowest cost at sufficient quality standard. 

# Business Sectors
_Primary_  Extraction, harvesting, conversion of natural resources or raw materials (i.e. Farming, logging, mining, fishing). Humanity has primarily relied on this until the last few hundred years. 
_Secondary_  Manufacturing, processing, production of products (or semi-finished ones) using said natural resources. (i.e. Construction, steel, automobiles). 
_Tertiary_ (Largest, most profitable) Selling and provision of services. (i.e. Retail, education, transportation). Many are small, but employers like the chain stores Walmart and Target are massive. 
_Quaternary_  Knowledge-focused service sector, with the rise of information flow, it slowly deviates from *tertiary* activities (but arguably yet still a part of them). Collecting, repackaging, selling, providing information, as well as web-services, or media. (Programming, Information, R&D, Business Adviser, Design Engineer).
_Chain of Production_
Primary -> Production (all input)/Manufacturing( tangible input) -> Services (Tertiary & Quaternary Output) -> Consumers
*Businesses can operate in 1+ (integrated companies) of sectors, but as the market is fluid, this can change. (Major oil companies drill, refine into products, and sell at stations, “independents” only drill and sell oil for refinement).* 
*(Car industry: Integration is not dominant (i.e. Elon musk brought to court for wanting to sell Teslas in his company’s dealerships).)*
*(Fashion: Depends on company. Some chains only design and sell, or add slight manufacturing. Luxury brands increase to maintain quality.)*

__Production Types:__
_Project/Job Based_  One unit manufactured at a time. For large or customized products, where open communication during process is required. Workers are specialized (yacht, haircuts). 
_Batch Production_ Production of similar items in groups by stage. Nowadays common for workers to only be operating machinery (bakeries, textiles). 
_Mass/Intermittent Production_Production of standardized products in large quantities and generate counter-demand inventories. All stages passing simultaneously, but may include different products in “batch” production as well. Heavy equipment/machinery and worker investment. (Phones, cars). 
_Flow/Continuous_ Process runs 24/7 to reduce cost and efficiency for high value products, highly automated. (Oil/gas, steel). 

__Sectoral Change__
Sectoral change closely affects how companies/individuals’ roles expand, contract, or shift (i.e. Industrial Revolution). With increase in technology and QOL, more services and products have appeared. Tertiary surpassing secondary. -> _Deindustrialization::. Some LEDCs have not left reliance on primary behind.

* Hard to break into established markets with strong competitors and loyal customer bases. 
* Hiring qualified personnel who prefer more stable incomes may be impossible unless ownership interest or other compensation is given. 
* Lack of management skill in dealing with problems, not wanting to cease control or bad financing may cause expensive problems. 

![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-07%20at%209.04.43%20AM.jpg)

# Organization Types
![](Business%20Management/1.2.2.1-An-overview-of-the-different-types-of-organisations-included-in-the-syllabus.5125e3f75acd915ee4a4.png)
### Public Sector
* Usually government-owned organizations providing public goods and services (military; infrastructure; higher education—Universities). 
* Local governments focus on more specialized regions, usually only _break even::; Central governments may subsidize them from tax, as the services are essential. 
### Private Sector
* Organizations owned by individuals or groups of them, consist of most “businesses.” Primary goal to own profits to compensate owners and sustain the company after investment. 
#### For Profit Types (by Size ⬇)
* _Sole Trader (Sole Proprietors/ships)_ Individuals owning and running businesses alone, legally considered one entity. Full control and profits kept, but also responsible for all consequences. Employees have no ownership interest. 
	* No-distinction between owner and business -> Death/Incapacitation leads to uncertain future. Heirs/Family may dispute control if unspecified. 
* _Partnerships_ Created by two or more “partners.” Governed by partnership agreements, which dictate ownership interests, decision making control, consequence of 1+ partners’ incapacitation. 
	* _Unlimited Liability:: (full legal responsibility that business owners and partners assume for all business debts). 
	* UL is also especially a disadvantage when one partners have limited control over each other. Creditors usually come after partner with most personal assets. 
	* Be careful when setting up! -> Try to prevent UL and other issues. 
* _Corporations_ Large organizations owned by individuals and shareholders. A ::Share:: allows voting at general meetings and the receiving of profits through dividends. 
	* Incorporation makes a business a separate legal entity, operating under _Limited Liability::. 
	* Shareholders will only lose ownership interest or investment, and outside investors can be obtained as there is no extra risk. 
	* Death of a shareholder does not impact function, and selling of shares generally has no major impact.
	* Public Corporation: Government owned. 
_Private Limited Company_ Owned by few shareholders, usually families. May be hard for shareholders to sell shares and ‘cash out’. 
_Public Limited Company:: A PLC wishing to obtain more capital can ‘go public’ in an IPO (Initial Public Offering), which allows shares to be accessible to the public. However, they have to publish all financial information, including to competitors, and may run the risk of a take over (see below). 
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-12%20at%206.42.36%20PM.jpg)

### Non-Profit Sector
* Commitment to purpose, a mission, not profit (many wealthy individuals providing grants). Non-profits “own themselves (no owners)”. 
	* University has no owners -> accountable to themselves and education. 
	* Funds gathered are used to run the institution and surplus is reinvested. Cumulative surplus is an _Endowment::(donation to nonprofit for investment in perpetuity), and interest earned on this contributes to costs. 
* Most nonprofits run by a _Board of Directors:: responsible for recruiting senior staff. Accountable to third parties. If proof is given of social improvements, most nonprofits need not pay taxes. 
* _NGO_Nonprofit; Non-Governmental; Non-political; Human rights not only focus; Non criminal. <- General Description, though last 2 may be blurry (AmInt, GrPc). 
* _Charity_ Similar organization. In UK, it has tax advantages, and is for: Charitable purposes only, acting in public/social/environmental benefit. In US, mostly refers to organizations helping those in need. 

# Company Attributes

### Mission/Vision Statement
_Vision_ A long term goal that an organization hopes to achieve in the future. 
_Vision Statement:: Expresses ⬆ vision to inspire everyone involved, somewhat idealistic/optimistic. 
_Mission Statement_ Complement vision statement by explaining the what the company is doing to achieve the vision, its role/purpose. 
* Critical during major turning points or decision making times, serving as a central reference point, but can evolve over time after series reflection. 
* Carefully worded and taken seriously by senior management, so employees take it to heart, and outside parties can understand it. 
* Organizations have come to collapse both into one for easier memorization or understanding. 

### Aims, objectives, strategies and tactics
~Survival -> Growth & Scale -> Profitability~
_Aims_ Broad/General goals an organization wishes to accomplish, probably vague and optimistic (mid-long term). 
_Objective_ Concrete, possibly shorter-term and more specific, measurable. Employees -> Prioritize work, break down steps to larger objectives or ultimately the aim. __(SMART).__ 
*Importance of A&Os vary from ownership, cultures, values, and can evolve based on market or employees/managers*

_Strategies_ Approach or plan formulated by an organization to achieve aims & objectives. *Can lead to prosperity or demise.* 
- TQM (See blow). 
- Ansoff [[Business Management Extra/Igor Ansoff’s Ansoff Matrix]] 
_Tactics_ Involves less important decisions and operate in shorter timeframes. Failure will be costly. 
*Strategies and Tactics can be different things for different organizations. Size-resources*
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-25%20at%2011.54.29%20AM.jpg)

#### Ethical Objectives & CSR
_Business Ethics_ How professional individuals, groups, organization set decision making priorities. -> __Ethical Objectives.__ 
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-25%20at%2012.05.45%20PM.jpg)

~_Corporate Social Responsibility_~
* Obligations to society and environment. Operate beyond observing basic regulations. 
* May be more expensive to be ethical (renewable price > oil price) -> Value is significant
* Head start in long term profits and obstacle avoidance from future regulations (carbon tax…)
* _Triple Bottom Line_ Company’s results based on profit, people and planet results for evaluation. 
* _Shared Value_ Advantage of CSR to society and corporations. Ethical actions related to business objectives. (i.e. Nestle supports coffee growers and therefore ensures a sustainable supply of HQ beans).

__Policies and Purposes for CSR Objectives:__
-> Labour Relations: 
		* Minimum standards for workers & fair treatment regardless of person.
		* Economic protection and benefits and training.
		* Develop & maintain a high-quality work force and attract talents. 
-> Environment:
		* Go beyond legal requirements for environment
-> Community: 
		* Support local communities and make donations. Encourage volunteering from employees. 
		* Good CSR can improve marketing, publicity, and customer loyalty. 
-> Supplier Relations: 
		* Consider practices of suppliers and subcontractors. (If supplier is unethical, get out!). 
> CSR : Cadbury and Hershey building high QOL and lower expense communities for workers to improve their lives. Cadbury looking for cocoa sources that did not involve slave labour. Modern CSR after 1990s when Nike was pressured to create more acceptable factory conditions in Asia.   
Rising numbers of _Social Audits::/::Sustainability Reports::/etc review the impact of companies paying more attention to their role and consequences in society. 92% of 250 largest global corporations publish such reports. 

# Stake Holders
[Stakeholder Interests](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/stakeholders/interests-of-external-stakeholders/)
[[Canadian Federal Government Simulation]]
* _Stakeholder_ *External* or *Internal* individual/group affected by or affecting an organization. (≠ Stockholder, Shareholder). 
* _Observer Status:: A limited privilege granted by some organizations to non-members to give them an ability to participate in the organization’s activities. IGO -> non-member states or INGOs. 
### Internal Stakeholders
* _Manager_ Run -> Aims/objectives -> Create environment -> Advance company and self (sensitive to reward, benefits, work condition, job security, and work content). 
	* Senior managers/CEO: Strategic direction
	* Middle managers: Carry out such
	* Junior managers (line/operating managers, supervisors, foremen): Day to day operations
* _Employee_ Individuals employed solely for work. (sensitive to reward, benefits, work condition, job security). Empowering them to contribute can improve collective outcomes. In a *knowledge economy*, many employees have professional expertise, so managerial-employee distinctions are thinning (similar interests). 
* _Shareholders_ (Primarily Corporate) Owners investing to receive returns (in dividends/ownership interest value (capital gain)) -> concerned with profitability. Shareholders appoint a BoD which appoints a CEO to run in their interest. Some may consider them external, as they are not much involved in day-to-day operation. 

### External Stakeholders (less direct influence)
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-16%20at%209.16.08%20PM.jpg)
* _Customers_ Purchase output, demand good service, quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Can be sensitive to company reputation and ethics. 
* _Suppliers_ Individuals/businesses selling inputs to other organizations at what they deem reasonable costs. Wish for stable supply-demand business relationships to maintain market, and therefore for partner’s health and existence. 
* _Governments_ Regulate organizations in public interest and enforce laws for consequences. May depend on large companies for tax and employment opps, or are customers of defence/pharmaceutical/etc industries. 
* _Unions_ Protect employee livelihood and rights, representing them in firms and have more resources for defense. 
* _Banks_ Lend funds for operation, wish for loan return on time with interest, and so follow liquidity (availability of liquid assets), solvency (possession of liability-separate assets), and other health indicators. Companies may renegotiate payback schedules. 
* _The Society/Environment_ Affected by corporate behavior (CSR). If government fails public interest, ::Pressure Groups::: may come in to force ethical corporate behavior. Local communities are most directly impacted by company actions, in any manner. 
* _Competitors_ Organizations opposing a company’s success, but are impacted by its actions likewise. Competing organizations expect fairness in legal and ethical actions, but may also cooperate in mutual interest. (*IB may not consider them stakeholders*)

__Mutual benefit and conflict of stakeholder interests__:
[Examples](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/stakeholders/areas-of-mutual-benefit-and-conflict/))
* Most stakeholder groups have positive outcomes from a firm’s success, though they each limit the level of fulfilment of each other’s goals (low cost leads to lower profit). 
* Management -> Reconcile competing stakeholder/shareholder interests, prioritizing more beneficial demands for company’s interest, and whether self serving parties are helpful. 

# STEEPLE and External Environment
__Chapter Contents:__
[[/Sociocultural Factors.]]
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-18%20at%208.48.39%20AM.jpg)
* Better understand __opportunities__ and __threats__ instead of *SWOT*, especially when investing in new market strategies (determine whether to enter, or modify offerings when entering). 
* Only useful when focused on specific businesses or lines of business (Disneyland rather than all Disney subsidiaries). 
* Including all relevant factors is more important than specifically categorizing them somewhere. 
- Companies need to constantly look out for changes in the external environment, so STEEPLE is not a one-time thing. Overlooking changes (especially threats) result in imperil the careers and the company’s future. Temporary company, or century spanning? 

## Sociocultural factors. 
* *The way people live ; beliefs and values.* 
* Dominant and minority __religions__, and their influence
* __Cuisine__ and dining habits. 
* __Family__ life, type and size.
* Demographics: fertility, life expectancy, services by age.
	*  __Pyramid of age__ [[Business Management Extra/Pyramid of Age]]
* __Health__ care and disease prevalence. 
* Formal __education__ and basic education percentage. Gender equality. 

## Technological factors
	* Rapid innovation in __information technology__ , and the blurring of the boundary between work and leisure. Software and devices have opened up new markets. 
	* Availability of __big data__ to understand more about clients needs. 
	* __Nanotechnology__ in textiles and electronics;__genetic engineering__ in medical and agricultural science. __3d printing__; __AI__; __robotics__. 
	* Availability of __infrastructure__(transportation, sanitation…) especially in L/MEDCs. Some countries are [leapfrogging](https://www.csis.org/analysis/need-leapfrog-strategy), going straight to more modern technologies from almost none. 
## Economic factors
* __Demand__ for products and services is different in each country, closely related to amount of discretionary income. Companies may change offerings or enter markets as living standards improve. 
![](Business%20Management/4.3.2.1-The-economic-cycle-and-lead-to-cyclical-variations.a590294dd86952ffda97.png)
![](Business%20Management/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-18%20at%204.59.06%20PM.jpg)
* Countries experience alternating periods of fast and slow growth (*where income and unemployment may be problematic, and demand drops; when supply drops, prices increase, and sales drop*). __Macroeconomics__. 
* Depression may follow recession
* Business cycle: Change in GDP over time
* Companies may employ policies such as fiscal (taxes..) or monetary (interest…) measures to prevent slows. 
* _Recession:: refers to the case where GDP decreases for two or more quarters. 
_Depression:: is used to describe a prolonged or particularly severe recession. There is no established criterion for defining depression in an economic context.
*PPP for GDP meaning?* vs *nominal*
## Environmental factors
* __Quantity__ and __quality__ of usable fresh water, a constraint in business activity, especially for power and agriculture. 
* __Climate change__ altering worldwide weather patterns and impacting businesses. International climate change agreements will provide opportunities to some and restrictions on other. Companies each have a *carbon footprint*. 
* __Protection__ of species and habitats can limit development, although for example, for cosmetics, biodiversity can be a source of inspiration. 
- __Recycling__ or __disposal__ of growing solid waste accumulation, can also be costly or beneficial. __Air quality__-> expensive pollution regulation compliance vs bad air quality consequences (relocation). car

## Political factors
* __Political regime__ (constitutional monarchy, dictatorship…) and stability of civil issues (regime change?). __Elections__ and new political parties? Business-political relationships? 

## Legal factors
* Abide by __laws__ and __regulations__ from central or local governments in home or operating countries. Look out for rules that can change business activities. Some companies higher *lobbyists* to push for beneficial legislation. 
* __Litigation__ (lawsuit) issues. Governments, other companies, employees, or consumers may sue business for unethical behavior or lack of responsibility and trustworthiness. Long processes may require arbitration (independent 3rd party settling). Potential for such complications and expensive settlements (going to billions) is a huge factor. 

## Ethical factors (CSR!)
* __Marketing__ of products that is unsuitable or not in consumer best interests (tobacco is not for teens; selling investment products not understood by investors). 
* __Unfair__ treatment and wages given to local (usually developing country) employees compared to those given in organization’s home countries. Especially for NGO. 
* __Unfair__ labour practices. [Zero-hour contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract)
* __Pricing policies__, ie. Ethical problems with discriminatory (*variant prices for same service/product based on customer agreement*) and predatory (*company with more resources lowers price to drive competition out of business*) pricing. Should drug companies lower prices for L/MEDCs?
* __Corruption__ extent in countries — measured by Corruption Perceptions Index (Transparency International). Buying votes, bribes, etc. International companies decide whether to engage with unethical countries and if so how to adapt policies. 
* 
# Growth and Evolution
_Market Capitalization_ The value of a company in the stock market. 
## Economy of Scale
* Structure and size of operations. Higher level of output can create lower production costs, and creates advantage over direct competitors. 
* Average unit cost of production decreases with output. 
* Such factors have initial costs, but total internal costs go down as output increases. 
* __Purchasing__: Lower input cost when purchasing in bulk. 
* __Technical__: Investment in good equipment results in eventual production cost reduction. Automation and efficiency at a certain extent reduces average fixed costs. 
* __Marketing__: Marketing campaigns and mediums for single output units are spread over larger and larger sales volumes. 
* __Managerial__: Revenue will allow hiring of more competitive and productive managers for each of the *business functions* and in theory decrease costs by efficiency in expertise. 
__Financial__: Cost of capital decreases as larger corporations negotiate larger mutual trust—*as financing requirements grow*— borrowing deals. (Corporate bonds).

*External*: Existing infrastructure, skilled local labour force, good transport links, supportive legislation are good external factors for economies of scale. 
## Diseconomy of Scale
* Average unit cost of production increases with level of output, such as due to management issues with efficiency drop. 
* __Managerial__: Size of an enterprise has limits, and a smaller focused team on vision is more efficient. A CEO may have trouble coordinating huge masses of employees and divisions between them, unless most employees are low-skill hires (factory).  
* __Workforce size Increase__: Complex organizational hierarchies can increase wage expenses and overcrowding issues. Certain jobs may be highly isolated or specialized and lead to feelings of lack of involvement. 
* __Communication__: Complex structures may complicate communication, especially for multinational corporations. 

![](Business%20Management/1.6.1.2-Graph-showing-economies-and-diseconomies-of-scale..37140b2360fd17b72e27.png)
*External*: Growing industry sizes causing long average costs—traffic congestion, competition for scarce resources, high renting costs due to firm concentration, are external diseconomies of scale. 

## Small vs Large Companies
[Chart](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/growth-and-evolution/the-merits-of-small-vs-large-organizations/)
__Capital Requirements__: Some equipment and infrastructure investment-heavy industries require large companies. Others require minimal investment, and can be run by sole traders. 
__Economies of scale__: Organizations usually become larger with the potential of economies of scale, able to reduce supplier costs, and smaller ones may not have any competitive advantage. 
__Competition__: Larger organizations may provide better prices/services to customers, and can afford temporary losses to reduce competitors (predatory pricing). 
__Market__: Smaller organizations may be suited to niche markets with less customers, more custom products, and closer client ties. (i.e. Antique repairment). Standardized production suit large companies—computers that are used by millions. 
__Owner’s Objectives__: Businesses may wish to maximize profits, or simply to meet familial financial needs, as scaling (especially for sole traders), may not be worth the stress, or the inevitable loss of control. Some may not even hire or take loans. However, this does limit capital access. It may not always be possible to remain small and operate, as economies of scale in certain industries push large competitors to remove you from the equation. 
_Profit satisficing_ behavior of business owners who choose not to grow their business because the existing enterprise meets their financial needs. 

# Internal and External Growth
Different growth types can be considered for different circumstances: 
Timing (external fast), Competition (acquisition of competitor), Regulation (acquisition may be blocked due to monopoly threat), Risk (internal is safer, also JV or strategic alliance), Proprietary (external is often hard to maintain privacy), Culture (external growth may be hindered by cultural difference). 
### Internal Growth__ —AKA __Organic Growth__
Expansion carried out by organization alone (adding tables to restaurant), may take time, but there is control. 
### External Growth__
Involves other organizations. Promotes quick expansion and efficient meeting of objectives, and the gaining of expertise, though there may be significant risks, such as the exposure of proprietary information, culture clash, etc. Strategic 
__Mergers, acquisitions and takeovers__
* *Mergers & Acquisitions*:  Result in fundamental structure of companies, and cannot easily be reversed, therefore are riskier. Can be larger/small operations. Large companies like Facebook acquiring companies like WhatsApp may not affect future if unsuccessful. Mergers of equals are especially risky, and 50% of mergers end in failure. Merging of companies may not create a unified entity, however ideal the strategic plan was, primarily due to company culture. It is AOL - Time Warner, conjoined, not unified.
* [Apparently Mergers of Equals don’t Exist?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2014/06/05/why-corporate-mergers-of-equals-almost-never-work/#502f56404176)
* _Merger_ Results in two firms combining to form one entity replacing both.  (A + B = AB). 
* _Acquisition_ One firm purchases another (50% or more of company B’s ownership interest, usually 100%). Parent company -> Subsidiary relationship. Both exist as legal entities, but A controls B’s actions. Disney -> Pixar. 
* _Takeover_  Takeovers can be *hostile (usually when in financial press)*: senior managers of target film are in opposition (shareholders sell without consent).  __|__ *friendly*:  management favors operation and recommends the sale of shares to acquiring company. Shares bought from shareholders at a price exceeding stock market value. Takeovers can lead to acquisitions or mergers. 
_Goodwill_  Value found of company’s good name and recognition value, or reputation. Physical locations and assets enhance such goodwill. Amount of value attributed to your company’s franchises, licenses, etc, over purchase cost. 
_Transient Advantage_ Business __strategy__ that accepts that competitive advantages are often short lived. It focuses on innovation strategies that continually build new advantages.

__Joint ventures__
* Flexible, creates separate entity with equal investment from parties that can be dissolve at ends of projects at no compromise to businesses. (JVs). Share cost of and expertise for expensive business endeavor. 
* Used to reduce risk of developing costly assets and others. Many JVs end when the venture is purchased by one partner. Can be small projects (especially for startups) or major diversification purposes. 

__Strategic alliances__
* NO NEW ENTITY CREATED. Can be easily modified or terminated based on partnership and external environment. Alliances can be 2+ cooperations or result in development of closer working arrangements with JVs or mergers. (i.e. Airline Star Alliance, seamless service transfer even on international layovers)

### Globalization
__Trade barriers__are regulatory obstacles that limit trade between countries. Trade barriers include tariffs and quotas.

[Table](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/business-management-hl-2016/business-organisation-and-environment/growth-and-evolution/external-growth-franchising/)
* Arrangement between franchisor (company with successful business model who wants to expand) and franchisee. Franchisor can open outlets through internal growth, but finding partners who will do so may be advantageous and reduce risk. 
* Franchisees pay royalties and initial fees to buy the rights to use the name and business model of a franchisor, and must respect its practices and norms—little innovation room. They are supported by purchasing and marketing, training and good practices, legal advice and managerial software. Removes entrepreneurial risk —economies of scale. 
* Franchisee finances typically finance outlets alone, and keep most profit, and thus may have more motivation than employees of the franchisor. They also have local knowledge, which is good for international business. 
* Franchisor loses control of outlets, or direct access to customers, and a mistake can sometimes damage the larger company, and other franchisees. 
* Franchisees can be large organizations, who run multiple franchises of a larger corporation, or sole-traders.
