# 11.1 Electromagnetic Induction 

## Essential idea: 
The majority of electricity generated throughout the world is generated by machines that were designed to operate using the principles of electromagnetic induction

## Nature of science: 
Experimentation: In 1831 Michael Faraday, using primitive equipment, observed a minute pulse of current in one coil of wire only when the current in a second coil of wire was switched on or off but nothing while a constant current was established. Faraday’s observation of these small transient currents led him to perform experiments that led to his law of electromagnetic induction

## Understandings: 
-Electromotive force (emf) 
-Magnetic flux and magnetic flux linkage 
-Faraday’s law of induction 
-Lenz’s law 

## Applications and skills: 
-Describing the production of an induced emf by a changing magnetic flux and within a uniform magnetic field 
-Solving problems involving magnetic flux, magnetic flux linkage and Faraday’s law 
-Explaining Lenz’s law through the conservation of energy

## Guidance: 
-Quantitative treatments will be expected for straight conductors moving at right angles to magnetic fields and rectangular coils moving in and out of fields and rotating in fields 
-Qualitative treatments only will be expected for fixed coils in a changing magnetic field and ac generators

# 11.2 Power Generation and Transmission
## Essential idea: 
Generation and transmission of alternating current (ac) electricity has transformed the world.

## Nature of science: 
Bias: In the late 19th century Edison was a proponent of direct current electrical energy transmission while Westinghouse and Tesla favored alternating current transmission. The so called “battle of currents” had a significant impact on today’s society.

## Understandings: 
-Alternating current (ac) generators 
-Average power and root mean square (rms) values of current and voltage 
-Transformers 
-Diode bridges 
-Half-wave and full-wave rectification 

## Applications and skills: 
-Explaining the operation of a basic ac generator, including the effect of changing the generator frequency 
-Solving problems involving the average power in an ac circuit 
-Solving problems involving step-up and step-down transformers 
-Describing the use of transformers in ac electrical power distribution 
-Investigating a diode bridge rectification circuit experimentally 
-Qualitatively describing the effect of adding a capacitor to a diode bridge rectification circuit 

# 11.3 Capacitance 

## Essential idea:  
Capacitors can be used to store electrical energy for later use.​

## Nature of science: 
Relationships: Examples of exponential growth and decay pervade the whole of science. It is a clear example of the way that scientists use mathematics to model reality. This topic can be used to create links between physics topics but also to uses in chemistry, biology, medicine and economics.

## Understandings: ​
-Capacitance ​
-Dielectric materials ​
-Capacitors in series and parallel ​
-Resistor-capacitor (RC) series circuits ​
-Time constant 

## Applications and skills: ​
