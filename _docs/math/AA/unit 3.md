# Quadratic Functions

## Forms of Quadratics

A quadratic function have 3 forms: Standard form, Vertex form, and
Intercept form.

$$\begin{aligned}
	y &= ax^2 + bx + c \\
	y &= a(x-h)^2 + k \\
	y &= a(x-p)(x-q) \end{aligned}$$

In the standard form, $a$ defines to concavity of the function. If
$a>0$, the quadratic concaves up, if $a<0$, the quadratic concave down.
$c$ represents the x-intercept of the quadratic.

In vertex form, $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the quadratic. A vertex is the
turning point of the quadratic, it is also where the axis of symmetry
lies. The quadratic is mirrored across the axis of symmetry.

In the intercept form, $p$ and $q$ are the x intercepts (or zeros) of
the function.

## Equations

The equation for the axis of symmetry is: $$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

The sum of roots of a quadratic is: $$(\alpha+\beta) = -\frac{b}{a}$$

The product of roots of a quadratic is:
$$(\alpha \cdot \beta) = \frac{c}{a}$$

## Finding the Roots

There are four ways to find the roots of a quadratic. You can graph it
using the GDC. You can use the quadratic formula. You can use complete
the square.

The quadratic formula is listed below:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

$\Delta = b^2-4ac$ is the discriminant. If:

-   $\Delta > 0$, the function have 2 real roots

-   $\Delta = 0$, the function have 1 unique real root

-   $\Delta < 0$, the function have no real roots.

To factor, simply factor the quadratic into the intercept form using the
sum and product of roots equations.

To complete the square, start with the equation in standard from. Set
$y$ to zero. Then, remove the coefficient of x (by factoring it out).
Afterwards, use the property $(a+b)^2  = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ to factor the
equation into vertex form.
