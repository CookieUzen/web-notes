# Oscillations

Oscillations is a repeating motion performed by an object.
For example a pendulum performs oscillation: it dangles from left to right, repeating forever (until friction slows it down).

## Period, Frequency, Amplitude

If an oscillation is periodic, it means it repeats itself every certain amount of time.
The time it takes to perform one oscillation is called the _period_ ($T$, SI unit seconds, $s$).
The _frequency_ ($f$, SI unit Hertz, $Hz$) of an oscillation is how many cycles an oscillation can do in a second.
Frequency is the inverse of period: $f = \frac{1}{T}$.

In a sinusoidal wave, _amplitude_ refers to the distance between the farthest point to the x axis. 
In terms of oscillations, amplitude often refers to the farthest point from the equilibrium position.

## Simple Harmonic Motion

If an oscillation fits all the conditions below, it can be classified as simple harmonic motion:
1. follows a fixed cyclical path
2. have a central equilibrium point
3. periodic
4. Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration changes continuously
5. A restoring force proportional to the displacement points towards the equilibrium point

There are two common types of SHM, spring and pendulum:

In a __spring SHM system__, a mass is attached to a stationary, massless spring. 
The object oscillates along the spring, compressing and retracting the spring. 
The spring force acts as the restoring force.
In this system, the energy of the system is composed of kinetic energy of the mass, and the elastic potential energy of the spring (and gravitational if the spring oscillates on a vertical axis).

In a __pedulum SHM system__, a mass is attached to the end of a stationary, massless rope.
The rope is then attached on something, gravity pulls the mass taunt.
The object then oscillates perpendicular to the direction of gravity (left and right), along the length of the spring.
In this system, the energy of the system is composed of kinetic energy of the mass, and the gravitational potential energy of the spring.

More information regarding the SHM can be found on unit 9.1.

# Traveling Waves

A traveling wave is defined as a disturbance that transmit energy across space.
Traveling waves do not transfer matter.

## Types of Traveling Waves

### Mechanical and Electromagnetic

There are two types of traveling waves, _mechanical_ and _electromagnetic_ waves.
Mechanical waves require a physical medium to oscillate.
An example of such wave is sound waves.

Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to travel in.
They are based on the perpendicular, fluctuating electric and magnetic fields coupled together.
We often classify electromagnetic waves by its frequency.
The electromagnetic frequency contains all of the electromagnetic waves.
Light is an electromagnetic wave.
All electromagnetic waves travel at _light speed_ ($c$, $3.00\cdot10^8 \; m\,s^{-1}$)

Below is a table of the electromagnetic spectrum:

| Wave          | Approximate wavelength |
|---------------|------------------------|
| gamma-rays    | $ < 10-12 m$           |
| x-rays        | $1 nm - 1 pm$          |
| ultraviolet   | $400 nm - 1 nm$        |
| visible       | $750 nm - 400 nm$      |
| near-infrared | $2.5 μm - 750 nm$      |
| infrared      | $25 μm - 2.5 μm$       |
| microwaves    | $1 mm - 25 μm$         |
| radio waves   | $ > 1 mm$              |

### Transverse and Longitudinal

Traveling waves can be further divided into _transverse_ and _longitudinal_ waves.

Transverse waves oscillate perpendicular to the plane at which the wave travel.
A transverse wave look like a sine curve, with the particles at the highest and lowest point making up the amplitude, and the particles in the middle making up the equilibrium position.
Light is a transverse wave.
All electromagnetic waves are transverse waves.

A longitudinal wave oscillates along the plane at which the wave travels.
A longitudinal wave have sections of compression (higher density) and rarefaction (lower density).
Compression the amplitude, and rarefaction are the points of equilibrium.
Sound is a longitudinal wave.
All longitudinal are mechanical waves.

# Wave Characteristics

## Characteristics Traveling Waves

A traveling wave can be measured by its frequency, amplitude, and wavelength.
In the context of traveling waves, amplitude is the farthest distance a particle can be from equilibrium.
Wavelength ($\lambda$, SI Unit meters, $m$) is the length of the wave, between two points that are in phase (or the distance between two equilibrium positions).

The speed of a wave ($c$, SI Unit $ms^{-1}$)is the product of a wave's frequency and wavelength:
$$ \begin{aligned}
	c = f\lambda
\end{aligned}$$

Note, the frequency of a wave depends on the _source_ of the wave.
The speed of a wave depends on the _medium_ a wave is traveling.
This will be further discussed in [4.4 Wave Behavior](#Wave Behavior).

The relationship between the intensity (energy of a wave over area of the wave) and amplitude follows the square law.
While the relationship between the intensity of a wave and the distance from the source of a wave follows the inverse square law.

$$ \begin{aligned}
	I &\propto A^2 \\
	I &\propto x^{-2}
\end{aligned}$$

If a line is drawn across a wave, where every point on the line has the same phase, the line would be called the wavefront.


### Graphing Traveling Waves

### Phase

The phase of a wave measures at what part of a wave is a particle at.
We measure phases in angles ($\theta$, in degrees or radians).
A phase of $360^{\circ}$ or $2\pi$ is the entire cycle of a wave.
If two waves are in phase, and have the same frequency, the waves are _coherent_.

When two waves or two points of a wave is in phase, it means that they are starting on the same cycle.
Or that the two waves are in sync.
For example, points on the equilibrium position of a wave are always in sync.

We can measure the distance between the points on a wave with phases.
Since $360^{\circ}$ and $2\pi$ is a whole cycle, then we can use ratios to find out the distance.
For example, a wave out of phase by $\pi$ has a displacement difference of $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$.

When phase shift a wave, we displace the wave by the ratio of its wavelength.
Similar to the example above, a wave phase shifted by $\pi$ is shifted by a displacement of $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$

## Superposition

When multiple waves collide, their amplitude are added together.
The act of the combination is called _superposition_, and the result is _interference_.

Constructive interference is when the two waves add together, creating a wave that has a larger amplitude at every point.
Destructive interference is when the two waves add together, creating a wave that has a smaller amplitude at every point.

## Polarization

Unpolarized oscillates on more that one plane.
Polarization removes all planes except for one.
Only transverse waves can be polarized.

Waves can be polarized with a polarizing filter, or by bouncing of a smooth surface (polarized along the plane of the surface).
At a specific angle, _Brewster's angle_, waves bouncing off surface is fully polarized.

Polarizing an unpolarized light will reduce its intensity to half the original intensity.
You can calculate the intensity of a polarized wave after passing through a polarizer (polarized at least twice) by the equation below: 
$$ \begin{aligned}
	I = I_0 \cos^2\theta
\end{aligned} $$

# Wave Behavior

Waves can be modified when passing through different mediums.

## Reflection

When a wave meets a smooth flat plane, the plane can redirect the wave without absorbing the waves' energy.
This is called reflection.
The original wave is called the _incident wave_, while the reflected wave is called the _reflected wave_.

If a line perpendicular to the plane is drawn at the point of reflection (normal line), then the angle between the incident wave and the normal line would be the same as the angle between the reflected wave and the normal line.

## Refraction

Refraction occurs when a wave enters a different medium that the one it is originally traveling in.
If we draw the normal line perpendicular to the separation between the two medium, two angles would be formed.
The _angle of incidence_ ($\theta_i$) between the normal and the indent wave, and the _angle of refraction_ ($\theta_r$) between the normal and the refracted wave.

The refractive index measures the speed of wave in a medium compared to the speed of the wave in vacuum.
Snell's law models the relationship between the refractive index and the angles.

$$\begin{align}\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{\sin\theta_2}{\sin\theta_1} = \frac{v_2}{v_1}\end{aligned}$$

## Diffraction

Diffraction occurs when a wave travel through a slit/opening (the size of the opening have to be comparable to the wavelength in order for noticeable diffraction).
_Huygen's wave theory_ says that every point on a wavefront can be separated into a new circular wave called the wavelet.
Constructive interference then combines all the wavelets together to create a uniformed wavefront.

Due to this, when a wave pass through a slit, the edges of the wave (after passing through the slit) are slightly round, facing away from the slit. 
While all other points on the slit remain the same.

## Interference
Interference occurs two coherent waves interact with each other.
In the case that two coherent sources are put next to each other, then an interference pattern will be created.

In order for constructive interference to occur, the path difference between the two waves have to $n\lambda$, where $n$ is a whole number.
In order for destructive interference to occur, the path difference between the two waves have to $\left ( \frac{1}{2}+n\right )\lambda$, where $n$ is a whole number.


# Standing Waves

Standing waves are special type of wave.
It propagates energy, but does not transfer matter.
Each point on a stationary wave have its own amplitude, but oscillates with the same frequency. 
Standing waves are created when two traveling collide.
Standing waves are normally found on a string/container with one or more loose end/open end.

## Characteristics of Standing Waves

The node of a standing wave is a point on the standing wave where the amplitude is zero.
The anti-node of a standing wave is a point on the standing wave where the amplitude the maximum.

## Harmonics

Standing waves can form harmonics.
To find out the wavelength of each harmonic, draw out the standing wave.
