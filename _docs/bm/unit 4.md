# 4.1 Role of Marketing

Marketing must work with each and every one of the business functions in order to develop the best and most optimal brand strategies: 

- **Human Resources Function**: A business must maintain the right quantity and quality of staff for marketing objectives. Recruitment and training must be coordinated with sales forecasts. Growth or loss of sales will also inherently induce recruitment or redundancy. 

- **Finance and Accounts Function**: Marketing activities will be constrained by budget, and thus ongoing back-and-forth with finance is necessary. Market research, advertising, and product design will incur further costs, but they won't guarantee success (repositioning products in the consumer's mind). Risks and values must be evaluated in this case. 

- **Operations Function**: Market research is pivotal in guiding R&D (Research and Development), and vice a versa, innovations will be sent to be marketed. Sales forecasts are useful to determine capacity to meet demand.

# 4.2 Marketing Planning

A _marketing plan_ is a document that outlines the entire marketing process.
It starts with objectives, then the target market, marketing mix, and control tools.
This subtopics talks about how to make and use marketing plans.
Correct use of marketing plans will increase a company's chance of achieving their marketing objectives.

## Elements of a Marketing Plan

The main elements of a marketing plan includes:
- Marketing objective
- Marketing budget
- Segmentation and target market
- Market research
- Marketing strategies
- Control tools

#### Marketing Objective

The company's marketing goal.
Should help towards the company's corporate objective.

#### Marketing Budget

Money allocated to marketing.
There are three major methods of marketing:

- __Objective based__: estimate based on objective
- __Sales based:__ fixed percentage of sales revenue
- __Incremental based:__ based on last year's budget, normally increases every year

Objective based is the most flexible, but hardest to get correct.

#### Segmentation and Target Market

Marketing segmentation breaks consumers into groups with similar characteristics and needs.
This is like categorizing customers by special traits.
These traits vary across businesses types.
For example, a gym might segment their market based on the fitness of their customers.

#### Marketing Research

Marketing research is the act of gathering information about the needs of consumers.
There can be their habits, tastes, needs, and more.
Effective market research allows companies to find new opportunities that they can take advantage of.

#### Marketing Strategy

Marketing strategies are long term actions that can achieve the marketing objective.
These are guided by the marketing mix.

#### Control Tools

Control tools are used to determine if the marketing strategy is successful.
Is is done by gathering data (both qualitative and quantitative), which are then compared with parameters.
Some common places which data can be gathered from are:

- sales figures
- customer retention rates
- customer perception surveys and focus groups
- market analysis reports

### The Role of Marketing Planning

Marketing plans should allow managers to create a coherent marketing strategy.
While marketing plans are useful, they also have limitations. 
Time and resources are required to create proper marketing plans.
Smaller companies may not have the resources to create effective marketing plans.

Marketing plans should only be seen as a guide.
Often, the market changes.
The marketing plan should be readjusted accordingly.

### The Marketing Cycle

- Marketing objectives set
- Target market identified
- Market research carried out
- Marketing strategies developed and implemented

## The Four P's

This section is a brief introduction to the Four P's. 
Refer to 4.5 for more detailed information.

The marketing mix is formed by the Four P's.

1. Product
2. Price
3. Promotion
4. Place

### Product

Products are broken down into good and services.
Goods are things that can be physically interacted with (buying a movie DVD).
Services are things done for you, that you cannot touch (watching a movie at a theater).
The design, features, colors, sizes, of goods, and the quality of the services are focused on in the product range.

### Pricing

The cost of a product will largely influence if customers are willing to pay.
This is effected by internal and external factors, such as the cost of production and the prices of competitors.

### Promotion

Promotion can be above-the-line or below-the-line.
Above the line promotion is advertising broadly through media.
While below the line tactics is advertising in a more personal manner.
The method of promotion largely varies by the marketing objectives and the marketing budget.

### Place

The method of distributing a product is influential on how well it sells.
The choice from whether to use distributors, or where the physical retail stores are located, to online retailers is determined here.

## Adjusting the Marketing Mix

Different organizations have different goals, and the marketing mix should be adjusted accordingly.

# 4.4 Market Research

## 4 P of Market Research

Market research is an essential tool that allow companies to stay up to date with their customers, competitors, and stakeholders. Without proper market research, businesses can run into a lot of issues, for example, selling products that no one wants.

Market research can be split into four major areas, or the _four P's_.

- Product
- Price
- Promotion
- Place

### Product

Product based research is a method of research done by testing products on potential customers. This allows companies to understand customer's reaction before releasing a product to the market.

This type of research is comprehensive. Sometimes companies can decide whether to launch a product based on information gathered from product based research.

### Price

Price based research is research done on the pricing of products. This can involve finding out the pricing of competing products or what customers are willing to pay for. This type of research decides the pricing of products.

### Promotion

Promotion based research deals with allowing companies to understand the avenues of marketing. Whether it is social media or a simple newspaper, companies have to discover which media types are accessed by their target audience.

This research can sometimes link to finding out more about the target audience. This can be done either by primary research, or buying customer profiles from companies that focus on conducting market research. 

### Place

Place based research is responsible for finding out the method of distribution of a product. Companies research into which physical (and digital) locations can contribute to the sales of the product. Often, valuable information can be gathered by simplify asking the target market.
