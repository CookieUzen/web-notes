# General Principles

A problem is a situation that needs to be solved.
An important part of computer science is identifying and solving problems.
When solving problems, it is important to think logically beforehand.

In CS, programmers use `algorithm` to solving some issues.
An algorithm is a series of _unambiguous instructions_ designed to achieve a certain goal in a _finite number of steps_.
An algorithm often have an input and an output.
