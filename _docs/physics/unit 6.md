# Circular Motion

When an object is moving in a circle, it is undergoing circular motion.
A uniformed circular motion is when the linear velocity stays constant.
We will only be looking at uniformed circular motion in IB.

In circular motion, the linear velocity is constant, but velocity is
always changing. There is a constant acceleration towards the center of
the circle. The velocity of the object is always a tangent to the
circle.

In order for a circular motion to exist, an object must be moving
tangentially to another object, while a centripetal force is exerted on
the object.

## Angular Displacement

Angular displacement ($\theta$) is the angle an object travels in
circular motion. This is measured in Radians (rad). To convert between
radians and degrees: $$\pi\; rad = 180^\circ$$

## Angular Velocity

Angular velocity ($\omega$) measures the change in angle overtime.
$$\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$$ Where $t$ is time.

## Period and Frequency

Period ($T$) is defined as the time taken to complete one revolution
around the circle. The SI Unit of period is seconds ($s$).
$$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$ $2\pi$ is the total angle of the circle, and
$\omega$ is the angular velocity.

Frequency ($f$) is defined as the revolutions that can be completed in
one second. The SI Unit of frequency is Hertz ($Hz$). One hertz is one
revolution per second. $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

## Linear and Angular Velocity

Linear velocity measures the speed of rotation.
$$v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$$ Where $r$ as the radius of the circle.

The relationship between linear velocity and angular velocity is:
$$v = \omega r$$

## Centripetal Acceleration

Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration of the object as it
undergoes circular motion. $$a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r = v\omega$$

## Centripetal Force

Centripetal force is the resultant force required to keep an object in
circular motion. Similar to the acceleration, centripetal force points
to the center of the circle.
$$F = ma = m \frac{v^2}{r} = m \omega^2 r = mv\omega$$

The centripetal force itself is not a force. It is a combination of
other forces. For example, when a car undergoes into circular motion,
friction between the car and ground is the centripetal force. For a
satellite that is undergoing circular motion, its centripetal force is
gravity.

# Newton's Law of Gravitation

Gravity is a force one mass exerts on another.

## Gravitational Field Strength

Gravitational field strength is the force per unit mass experienced by a
point mass placed at a specific point. $$g = \frac{F}{m}$$ Where $g$ is
the acceleration due to gravity, or gravitational field strength. $F$ is
the force due to gravity, and $m$ is the mass of the object.

## Newton's Law of Gravitation

The force due to gravity can be calculated using the equation below.
$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ Where $F$ is the force, $G$ is Universal
Gravitational Constant ($6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}$), $m$ and $M$ are the mass
of the objects, and $r$ is the distance from the center of mass.

If we plug this equation into the equation for gravitational field
strength, we find another equation for gravitational field strength:
$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$

## Orbit

For an object to remain in orbit, it means it is circular motion with a
planet. Likely, the only centripetal force acting on the object is
gravity due to the planet. Thus, we can model this relationship in an
equation. $$\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

The orbit velocity of a satellite can be calculated using the equation
above. By simplifying, we get the resultant equation:
$$V_{orbit} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$

Further expansion of this equation can give us Kepler's third law.
$$T^2 \propto r^3$$
