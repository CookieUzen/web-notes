I'm sure all of you know what **procrastination** is, and might work anxiously day and night to overcome it. You might see some of your friends doing worse than you, and start to relax. Then, you read a blog about this Asian kid younger than you who's juggling four extracurriculars, two sports, an internship, skipped a grade, and has a scholarship to *Harvard*. 

<!--more-->

We're getting off topic, but the point is this, how do you stay productive? How can you know what to do everyday, and preferably at every moment as well? I have been in your shoes, and thus, I have also spent countless hours trying not to be. I used to finish summatives of all kind 0.5—1hrs before the deadline (work *effectiveness* will probably be in another post), and trust me, it is not sustainable. 

Ironically, in the past few years, I might've spent more time looking for *ways* to be productive rather than being productive. In that time, I have decided that there are many ways to do work, but nobody can really avoid a good old todo list. *There are so many choices online! I know!* I have aggregated a few of the most common options and will talk about some of their use cases and shortcomings. 

Keep in mind that I use a *Mac+Android Phone+iPad* ecosystem, and prioritized one-time purchase apps and subscription-based apps with free plans (student style).

*Here's the list (in no order):*

* [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com) [My main]
* [Unclutter (quick to-do/thoughts)](https://unclutterapp.com)  [My submain]
* [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com)
* [Things 4](https://culturedcode.com/things/) 
* [Notion (Kanban Feature)](https://www.notion.so/) [^1] 
* [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)
* [Bear](https://bear.app/)
* If you're nuts, any Email server.
* Others

Here's also a quick table noting their attributes

| Attributes  | Pricing (in RMB, rounded up)                      | Cross-device Sync | Platform Availability | Type               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Todoist     | Free for basic; 26/month, 233/year.               | Yes               | All                   | Todo-List          |
| Unclutter   | 132 (one time)[^2]                                | No                | Mac Only              | Mac Extension      |
| TickTick    | 18/month, 181/year,                               | Yes               | All                   | Todo-List          |
| Things 4    | 323/Mac, 65/iOS & Watch, 130/iPad (one time) [^2] | Yes if paid       | Anything Apple        | Todo-List          |
| Notion      | 26/month, 396/year                                | Yes               | All                   | Project Management |
| Google Keep | Free! (Requires VPN, obviously)                   | Yes               | All                   | Todo-List          |
| Bear        | Free for basic; 12/month, 123/year                | Yes if paid       | Anything Apple        | Note Taking        |
| Mail Server | Whatever your mail client costs, I hope nothing   | Yes               | All                   | Other              |

Before we begin, it is also worth mentioning that there are a few differences between to-dos and actual todo-lists. Apps mentioned above like Unclutter or Bear—and any other notes app you use—allow you to just keep random things to do in text form. You may also find checkmark formatting like so:

***

**Things to do.note**

- [x] Regret
- [ ] Taking
- [ ] IB
- [x] Yet?

***

It's recommended you get an actual todo-list, but if you're like lazy and want to keep everything in one place, it's still better than nothing. 

# [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com) 

![Todoist1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/todoist1.png)

I used this app for over a year and a half, stopped for another two, and came back as DP hit. Two of the main great things about Todoist is the cross-platform sync (Apple/Android/Linux....), meaning that you can work it into your life no matter what devices you use, as well as its gamified [^3] productivity tracker. Todoist makes use of this thing called `Karma`. If you regularly make and complete tasks on time, as well as used advanced features to plan your days, you will get some. After obtaining certain amounts of `karma`, you will level up and get badges, but you can abruptly lose them if you fail to finish your tasks. It's a bit silly, admittedly, but you'll get kind of addicted for no reason. 

![Todoist2]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/todoist2.png)

Aside from this, Todoist is a very good to-do list manager. Each task can have sub-tasks, a due date, reminders (paid), a priority (1-4), and a label, so you have a wide range of methods to categorize them. Inbox keeps track of all your miscellaneous tasks (not part of a project), such as "pray to IB gods." There are also views for tasks due today or the next few days, so you won't ever see an empty schedule (which you shouldn't have anyways) and just start to relax. 

Add tasks to a project, such as "I&S Summative," so your to-dos don't get mixed up. Although, if you're on the free plan, I would suggest adding every subject under a "Classes" project and use a `Kanban` [^1]  column to manage each class, as you are limited to 5 projects. This is my DP configuration:

![Todoist3]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/todoist3.png)

Labels help you group up related tasks that may not be part of a project, for example, random ASA work that you have to do. Labels also help you to [Time-Block](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking), a good way to work productively. Filters allow you to look through your entire to-do list from now to the end of time and visualize different categories, for example, the most important tasks (priority 1) for the next few weeks. You can invite people who also use notion, and you can assign each other tasks inside a project. 

Lastly, Todoist has hundreds of [integrations](https://macstore.todoist.com/integrations) with apps like Notion (below), Spark mail, Teams, etc, so you can access it from all sorts of fun locations. One thing I hate though, is that reminders are premium, but that's really the only feature I lack right now, but I can sort of live without it. 


# [Unclutter](https://unclutterapp.com/)

![unclutter1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/unclutter1.png)

Unclutter is a Mac only extension tool, so if you're doing most of your work on a Mac and is not really on the go, then it'd be great. It's window shows up from the menu bar, depending on how you activate it in its preferences. I have it on scroll—if I go to an empty space in my menu bar and scroll down, it will appear—and ``command + shift + u``. There are three panes:

1. Files: You can point this pane to a specific folder for quick access to files in it. I have it on the default Unclutter folder, which is why it shows all my notes. 

2. Notes: Quick unformatted—no bold, no italics... —writing space. You can use this to add todos with "-" if you're a bit lazy. This is especially handy if you're working in another app and it can pop up if you drag it down. 

![unclutter2]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/unclutter2.png)

3. Clipboard: Stores all your last 10 copied items of all the most common formats, including images, text, code... Click on one to change what you will paste. Very handy if you want to copy like 10 different cheat-codes for your game. 


# [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com/)

![ticktick1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/ticktick1.png)

I haven't used TickTick all that much to say I'm anywhere an expert, but out-of-the-box it is pretty much Todoist with some distinctive features swapped. Two main, possibly game-ending things that TickTick has, which Todoist doesn't, is a calendar view (below), and a `Pomodoro`[^4] (above) feature, although both are premium-only. 

A calendar view is great, because you can easily visualize everything in blocks, and potentially apply the "Time Blocking" method we mentioned before. TickTick will also very easily integrate 2-ways with many of the calendars you use, so you can add and complete tasks in either TickTick or that calendar. If you want to use this with Todoist you can sync it to your local apple calendar, fantastical, but 2-way is only available for Google Calendar. A Pomodoro is pretty much a epic-er timer that encourages you to work without distraction in short bursts of time on specific tasks, which is efficient for people who easily get distracted. Personally I don't really need a cooler looking timer, since I usually just set one on my phone. 

TickTick also has a habit tracking tool for things that are not really tasks but just recurring or repeating things that you have to do. As an example "Pray to IB Gods" may just be something you do every morning at 8:29 am before school and 11pm before sleep, and you can track how often you manage to keep it up. It is also good for adaptive habits, for example, if you want to exercise for 1 more minute each day. If I deem something as habitual, I usually just do it, and can't be bothered to log it. 		

Another small thing to mention is that TickTick's UI (User-Interface) looks a bit better than Todoist's, which is important for some people, but personally I don't really mind the differences. 


# [Things 4](https://culturedcode.com/things/)

![things1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/things1.png)

I got to say, Things is pretty awesome. It doesn't have as nearly as much features as either Todoist or TickTick, but it just looks great in this dark-mode in general and is very simple to use. The circles are equivalent to projects, and the boxes are equivalent to labels or tags. The only real difference in tasks is that there is a thing called "Someday," for those tasks that you're gonna do "Someday," like actually follow your action plan timeline. 

Its sync with apple calendars is pretty epic. If you refer to the "9:00AM English App" task, I have added that from my Apple Calendar and it shows up immediately alongside all my other tasks. The stacked symbol on the top right allows you to open multiple windows of the app, but I haven't really needed to yet. 

Things 4 is great if you want to just have a simple, pretty, Todo-list, but it sucks that it is exclusive to apple, as I would've used it if it was simply available on android. There are ways to obtain it on a Mac, but to sync it with other platforms, they're a bit expensive for one-time purchase apps. However, for you loyal apple fan-people out there, this app would be kind of perfect. 


# [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

![notion1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/notion1.png)

Notion is, in itself, mainly a project management tool. However, if you already or will use it alot, it might be helpful to just add a todo Kanban board as a new page. Just like with a Todoist project you can customize each column with categories and add different cards inside. What's cool about Notion is that each card has way more options, such as embedding websites, math equations, images, tables, and more, so that you can use this feature as a research manager as well. For example, you can make a cool page like this, with drop downs, files, and even more pages inside:

![notion2]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/notion2.png)

I will probably talk about notion's other fantastic features in another post, but for now please refer to this guy's notion tutorials: [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl5FOMu8kI&list=PL7BImOT2srcEfz4QRfSKnKJLM_nTCMV7k). 


# [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)

![googlekeep1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/googlekeep1.png)

Ah, the good old wallpaper and sticky notes style to-do system. I used this throughout the entirety of my IB PYP years and through to the 6th grade, but it became a bit too simple, and, ahem, the colors look weird. However, if it doesn't look weird to you, and you just need a simple todo manager with categories you can yeet around, this is the tool for you. I would use it the same way I would with Unclutter, but each block has a few more options, including reminders, checklists, a logbook, collaborators, image support, and even labels. 

![googlekeep2]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/googlekeep2.png)

It is a pain for me to access though since it has no app and I don't have a VPN on at all times in order to go to a Google sub-page. But, if you have your VPN on all day at all times, or don't live in countries where google frameworks are banned, well, good for you. What's good about this then is you get a free sync-across-all-devices feature so you don't have to worry about anything being lost. 


# [Bear](https://bear.app/)

![bear1]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/todolist/bear1.png)

Bear is primarily a notes + writing app, so I would normally use it to make essay outlines, write essays, write down simple ideas, write poems or song lyrics, or record statistics about things :). Thus, if you make it your one-stop writing app, why not just keep your to-dos inside it as well? If you're writing something really quick, you can just pull up some markdown documentation and format your checklist. What's cool about doing it like this is that you can have all sorts of things like code or images in between to-do lists, if you need. There aren't anything like reminders or deadlines, but you can use tags to "simulate" different projects. 

And, that's pretty much it for these tools! Obviously I have only really brushed the tip of the iceberg, and I hope you can check their websites and try some of them out to see if you can come up with your own innovative ways to use them. All of them have much more features and no two apps are the same, so don't take my word for it as I only use them my way. 


# Other options

If you're still not convinced 🙄, however, here's a few more you can check out. It gets addicting to research this stuff, dunno why, so I suggest you try out some of the ones above first and at least figure out what you must have, so you can go look for your true love with prior knowledge and some demands.

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com)
  * Pretty similar to onenote, a huge notes app, but I don't like one note, and this one costs. It is popular among university students and adults, so I guess it's just an age gap thing? Dunno, you can check it out. 
* Apple Reminders 
  * This one comes with MacOS, but I have never put a single thing in it, it's just too simple and looks weird. 
* [Trello](https://trello.com)
  * If you've ever been in a teacher-run organization, chances are you've used this before. But this is mostly for large projects and especially teamwork, so it's a little too bloat [^5] for personal use. 
* [Habitica](https://habitica.com/)
  * Looks pretty interesting to me. It takes Todoist's karma gamification to a whole new level and almost has like an RPG interface. However, I don't need doing things to be that fun, I just need to get things done, especially since this might distract me even more. 
* [Microsoft To-Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/)
  * Just a free app that Microsoft offers because I guess they want to be everywhere. Pretty standard, looks average, but good for students. 
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/)
  * More of a project management app I think, but otherwise it is a huge todo application that is probably a bit overly complex for a student. Mostly used for adults and corporation teams. 
* If you still aren't convinced, I have nothing to say and just uh, [hope you have fun](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/blog/best-to-do-list-apps/). 


Now, whenever you sit down and think: "Nice, I have nothing to do today", you're either wrong or are procrastinating, so go check your to-dos!

That's all from me, please stay tuned for the next post! 

**P.S, I'm not sponsored by anyone here, and am doing this entirely out of my own free will. The only thing I've even paid for is Bear.** 

# Footnotes

[^1]:  A Kanban board is a type of task-tracking tool where you drag different blocks with content inside them into columns which categorize them. If you used Trello, that is it.
[^2]: Contact me first if your trial period ends
[^3]: Apply typical elements of game playing (e.g. point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to a normally non-game activity
[^4]: A type of timer, usually set in bursts of 25 minutes, for concentrated work.
[^5]: Overly complicated, or in computer science: just slow and bad.
