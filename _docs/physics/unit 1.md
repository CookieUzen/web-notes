## Physical Quantities and Units

### Physical Quantities

All measurements are made of the *seven* basic quantities, or `SI Base Units`.
The table shows their quantities and their units.

|        Time         |    second     |  $s$   |
|   Distance/Length   | meters/metres |  $m$   |
|        Mass         |   kilograms   |  $kg$  |
|       Current       |    amperes    |  $A$   |
|     Temperature     |    kelvin     |  $k$   |
| Amount of Substance |     mole      | $mol$  |

## Physical Quantities and Calculations

When plugging in quantities into an equation, **always be aware of unit conversion.**
A method to avoid calculation error with unit conversion is to treat the units as mathematical entities.

This is called quantity calculus.

## Scientific Notation

`Scientific Notation` leaves only one digit, and concatenate the rest as powers of ten.
For example: $4. 2 \cdot 10^4$​​.
The decimal places indicate how many digits of `significant figures` is the number accurate to.

### SI Prefix

A common list of `SI Prefixes` can be found below:

 Factor  | Name  | Symbol | English |   Factor   | Name  | Symbol| English 
:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:--------|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|:--------
 $10^1$  | deca  |  $da$  | Ten | $10^{-1}$  | deci  |  $d$| Tenth 
 $10^2$  | hecto |  $h$   | Hundred | $10^{-2}$  | centi |  $c$| Hundredth 
 $10^3$  | kilo  |  $k$   | Thousand | $10^{-3}$  | milli |  $m$| Thousandth 
 $10^6$  | mega  |  $M$   | Million | $10^{-6}$  | micro | $\mu$| Millionth 
 $10^9$  | giga  |  $G$   | Billion | $10^{-9}$  | nano  |  $n$| Billionth 
 $10^{12}$​ | tera  |  $T$   | Trillion | $10^{-12}$ | pico  |  $p$| Trillionth 
 $10^{15}$​ | peta  |  $P$   | Quadrillion | $10^{-15}$ | femto |  $f$| Quadrillionth 
 $10^{18}$​ |  exa  |  $E$   | Quintillion | $10^{-18}$ | atto  |  $a$| Quintillionth 
 $10^{21}$​ | zetta |  $Z$   | Sextillion | $10^{-21}$ | zepto |  $z$| Sextillionth 
 $10^{24}$​ | yotta |  $Y$   | Septillion | $10^{-24}$ | yocto |  $y$| Septillionth 

These values are very important during calculations, and thus it would be a good idea to remember prefixes from `giga` to `pico`, for example "giga-watts" ($GW$), or "pico-farads" ($pF$). A good way to start is to remember that from `deca` up to `kilo`, we have [$10^1 — 10^3$]. After that we start jumping by 3 zeroes, or $10^{x+3}$ [^1] . The same method works if we go down from `deci.` Except after the third sub-zero value `milli`, we jump by 3 decimal places instead, or **$10^{-x-3}$**. Keep in mind that one has no special name and is equal to $10^0$.



### Significant Figures

Significant Figures determines the amount of digits that is accurate in a certain calculation.
To find the significant figure of a number, we use the following rules: 

-   Left most *non-zero* digit is the `most significant digit` 
-   If there is no decimal points, the rightmost digit *non zero* digit is the `least significant digit`
-   If there is a decimal point, the rightmost digit is the `least significant digit`
-   All digits between the `most significant digit` and the `least significant digit` is significant.

When doing a calculation, always round to the smallest significant figure.
When rounding, round up with numbers above and including 5, and down with numbers below 5.



[^1]: Why? The most common everyday values are in the *tens* (10s), *hundreds* (100s), or *thousands* (100s), so we leave them be. After that, values are just multiples of these (*i.e. ten-thousand*), or of values starting from *one million* ($10^6$​​), such as "*one hundred million,*" or "*one hundred billion*." Notice how we don't have specific names like "*million*" and "billion" for values like "*one-hundred-thousand*."

## Uncertainties and Error

In physics, there will always be issues with uncertainty and errors.
It is important to take these into account when doing calculations with the data.

## Quantifying Uncertainties

## Combining Uncertainties

## Displaying Uncertainties

# Vectors and Scalars

Physical quantities can be grouped into two different categories, scalars and vectors.

## Define Scalars and Vectors

**Scalars** are units of measurement that only describe the magnitude of an object.
For example, distance is a `scalar`: it only describes how far you went in a given time interval (*10 meters in total*).

**Vectors** are units of measurement describing both magnitude and a direction.
For example, displacement is a `vector`, it describes the direction of movement and the distance traveled in a given time interval (*5 meters forward, 5 meters back*).

Below is a list of common `scalars` and `vectors` or their `vector` counterparts:

| Scalars                          | Vectors                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Speed                            | Velocity (Speed counterpart) [^2]        |
| Distance                         | Displacement (Distance counterpart) [^2] |
| Energy (of any kind) \ Work      | Acceleration                             |
| Power                            | Force                                    |
| Temperature                      | Momentum                                 |
| Pressure                         | Impulse                                  |
| Electric/Gravitational Potential | Electric/Gravitational Field Strength    |
| Mass                             |                                          |
| Volume \ Density                 |                                          |

[^2]: A vector counterpart cannot be derived from a scalar, for example, you cannot obtain average velocity from distance.




## Working with Vectors

We tend to break `vectors` into the x direction and the y direction.
This way, we can represent the `vectors` with positive and negative values.
For example, a force applied on a object upwards can be indicated with a positive sign, and a downwards force represented by a negative sign.

To separate the X and Y direction, we usually use trig function (sin cos tan).
