# 9.1 Simple Harmonic Motion

## Essential idea: 
The solution of the harmonic oscillator can be framed around the variation of kinetic and potential energy in the system.​

## Nature of science:  
Insights: The equation for simple harmonic motion (SHM) can be solved analytically and numerically. Physicists use such solutions to help them to visualize the behavior of the oscillator. The use of the equations is very powerful as any oscillation can be described in terms of a combination of harmonic oscillators. Numerical modeling of oscillators is important in the design of electrical circuits. 

## Understandings: ​

• The defining equation of SHM ​

• Energy changes ​

## Applications and skills: ​

• Solving problems involving acceleration, velocity and displacement during simple harmonic motion, both graphically and algebraically ​

• Describing the interchange of kinetic and potential energy during simple harmonic motion ​

• Solving problems involving energy transfer during simple harmonic motion, both graphically and algebraically 


## Guidance: ​

• Contexts for this sub-topic include the simple pendulum and a mass-spring system


## Utilization: ​

• Fourier analysis allows us to describe all periodic oscillations in terms of simple harmonic oscillators. The mathematics of simple harmonic motion is crucial to any areas of science and technology where oscillations occur. ​

• The interchange of energies in oscillation is important in electrical phenomena ​

• Quadratic functions (see Mathematics HL sub-topic 2.6; Mathematics SL sub-topic 2.4; Mathematical studies SL sub-topic 6.3) ​

• Trigonometric functions (see Mathematics SL sub-topic 3.4)

## Aims: ​

• Aim 4: students can use this topic to develop their ability to synthesize complex and diverse scientific information ​

• Aim 6: experiments could include (but are not limited to): investigation of simple or torsional pendulums; measuring the vibrations of a tuning fork; further extensions of the experiments conducted in sub-topic 4.1. 

• Aim 6: By using the force law, a student can, with iteration, determine the behavior of an object under simple harmonic motion. The iterative approach (numerical solution), with given initial conditions, applies basic uniform acceleration equations in successive small time increments. At each increment, final values become the following initial conditions. ​

• Aim 7: the observation of simple harmonic motion and the variables affected can be easily followed in computer simulations

# 9.2 Single-slit Diffraction

## Essential idea: 
Single-slit diffraction occurs when a wave is incident upon a slit of approximately the same size as the wavelength.​

## Nature of science:  
Development of theories: When light passes through an aperture the summation of all parts of the wave leads to an intensity pattern that is far removed from the geometrical shadow that simple theory predicts. ​

## Understandings: ​

• The nature of single-slit diffraction 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Describing the effect of slit width on the diffraction pattern ​

• Determining the position of first interference minimum ​

• Qualitatively describing single-slit diffraction patterns produced from white light and from a range of monochromatic light frequencies

## Guidance: ​

• Only rectangular slits need to be considered ​

• Diffraction around an object (rather than through a slit) does not need to be considered in this sub-topic (see Physics sub-topic 4.4) ​

• Students will be expected to be aware of the approximate ratios of successive intensity maxima for single-slit interference patterns ​

• Calculations will be limited to a determination of the position of the first minimum for single-slit interference patterns using the approximation equation

## Theory of knowledge: ​

• Are explanations in science different from explanations in other areas of knowledge such as history? ​

## Utilization: ​

• X-ray diffraction is an important tool of the crystallographer and the material scientist​

## Aims: ​

• Aim 2: this topic provides a body of knowledge that characterizes the way that science is subject to modification with time ​

• Aim 6: experiments can be combined with those from sub-topics 4.4 and 9.3 

# 9.3 Inteference:

## Essential idea: 
Interference patterns from multiple slits and thin films produce accurately repeatable patterns.​

## Nature of science: 
(1) Curiosity: Observed patterns of iridescence in animals, such as the shimmer of peacock feathers, led scientists to develop the theory of thin film interference. (2) Serendipity: The first laboratory production of thin films was accidental. 

## Understandings: ​

• Young’s double-slit experiment ​

• Modulation of two-slit interference pattern by one-slit diffraction effect ​

• Multiple slit and diffraction grating interference patterns ​

• Thin film interference 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Qualitatively describing two-slit interference patterns, including modulation by one-slit diffraction effect ​

• Investigating Young’s double-slit experimentally ​

• Sketching and interpreting intensity graphs of double-slit interference patterns ​

• Solving problems involving the diffraction grating equation ​

• Describing conditions necessary for constructive and destructive interference from thin films, including phase change at interface and effect of refractive index ​

• Solving problems involving interference from thin films

## Theory of knowledge: ​

• Most two-slit interference descriptions can be made without reference to the one-slit modulation effect. To what level can scientists ignore parts of a model for simplicity and clarity? ​

## Utilization: ​

• Compact discs are a commercial example of the use of diffraction gratings ​

• Thin films are used to produce anti-reflection coatings

## Aims: ​

• Aim 4: two scientific concepts (diffraction and interference) come together in this sub-topic, allowing students to analyze and synthesize a wider range of scientific information ​

• Aim 6: experiments could include (but are not limited to): observing the use of diffraction gratings in spectroscopes; analysis of thin soap films; sound wave and microwave interference pattern analysis ​

• Aim 9: the ray approach to the description of thin film interference is only an approximation. Students should recognize the limitations of such a visualization

# 9.4 Resolution 

## Essential idea: 
Resolution places an absolute limit on the extent to which an optical or other system can separate images of objects.​

## Nature of science: 
Improved technology: The Rayleigh criterion is the limit of resolution. Continuing advancement in technology such as large diameter dishes or lenses or the use of smaller wavelength lasers pushes the limits of what we can resolve.​

## Understandings: ​

• The size of a diffracting aperture ​

• The resolution of simple monochromatic two-source systems 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Solving problems involving the Rayleigh criterion for light emitted by two sources diffracted at a single slit ​

• Resolvance of diffraction gratings ​

## Guidance: ​

• Proof of the diffraction grating resolvance equation is not required

## International-mindedness: ​

• Satellite use for commercial and political purposes is dictated by the resolution capabilities of the satellite ​

## Theory of knowledge: ​

• The resolution limits set by Dawes and Rayleigh are capable of being surpassed by the construction of high quality telescopes. Are we capable of breaking other limits of scientific knowledge with our advancing technology? ​

## Utilization: ​

• An optical or other reception system must be able to resolve the intended images. This has implications for satellite transmissions, radio astronomy and many other applications in physics and technology (see Physics option C) ​

• Storage media such as compact discs (and their variants) and CCD sensors rely on resolution limits to store and reproduce media accurately

## Aims: ​

• Aim 3: this sub-topic helps bridge the gap between wave theory and real-life applications ​

• Aim 8: the need for communication between national communities via satellites raises the awareness of the social and economic implications of technology  ​
