# Sources of Finance

## The Role of Finance

There are many things companies spend money on.
This subsection will list some of the uses of finance.

One of the most common source of expenditure is `Capital`.
Capital investment is spending money on `fixed assets`, which are assets that are hard to sell.
Generally, `capital expenditures` are used to fund long term goals, such as building facilities or buying machinery.
Capital expenditures are often funded by long term sources of finance.

`Revenue expenditure` is spending money on general operation costs, expenditures such as wages or rent.
Revenue expenditures are often funded by short to medium term sources of finance.
When a firm cannot pay its revenue expenditure, they go into a state of `insolvency` (unable to pay debts).

## Internal Source of Finance

`Internal sources of finance` refers to money collected internally.
Such as the sale of assets, retain profit, or personal funds.

Common sources of Internal Finance are:
- __Personal Funds:__ money invested by the owners of the business 
- __Retained Profit:__ leftover (after paying the bills) from end of a trading year 
- __Sale of Assets:__ gained from selling any assets

## External Source of Finance

Opposite to `Internal Sources of Finance`, `External Sources of Finance` is money gathered through outside means.

### Equity Finance

Equity Finance is money gathered by selling ownership of the company.
Equity does not come with any interest, or requirement of repayment.
However, selling equity comes with the cost of losing control and dividends.

- __Share Capital:__ money raised through selling shares. 
- __Business Angel:__ wealthy investors, often buying a chunk of shares as investment. 
- __Venture Capitalist:__ companies that perform a similar role as Business Angels.

### Debt Finance

`Debt finance` is the method of borrowing money to acquire finance.
Often times, borrowing money can quickly bring money for investment, but at a high cost of `interest`.
Interest is additional money owed overtime as borrowed money is payed off.

- __Loan Capital:__ long term borrowing of money, often for the purchasing capital. These loans require collateral in case there is a default on the loan. 
- __Overdrafts:__ high cost, short term loan. It is when the company spend more money that they have in their account, and have to pay back in high interest. 
- __Credit Cards:__ a method of borrowing money and paying back every month.

### Financial Aid

Financial Aid is money given to the companies for free.
Generally, these come from NGOs or governments who want to support the business.

- __Subsidies:__ money given to the production of goods that is good for the society, often provided by the government 
- __Grants:__ are loans with no interest, and does not need to be paid back. There may be conditions on how the money is spent

### Other Sources of Finance

Other then the main sources of finance, there are others that does not fit the groups.

__Trade Credit:__ a method of paying for goods at a later date, without interest. Often provided to companies by companies. 
__Debt Factoring:__ the action of selling debt, to a debt factoring company. Often at a lower cost, but with an immediate payment. 
__Leasing:__ the action of leasing fixed assets instead of buying them. Flexible, but cost more in the long run.

## Short, Medium, and Long-Term Finance

External sources of finance can be broken into 3 types according to their durations.
Internal sources of finance can be fall into any of these categories.

### Short-Term

Short-term finance are repaid within 12 months.
These are normally used to solve cash flow problems or to pay for revenue expenditure.
Short-term finance is often expensive and have high interest.

Below is a list of short term finances: 
- Overdraft 
- Trade Credit 
- Debt Factoring 
- Leasing 
- Subsidies

### Medium-Term

Medium-term finance last longer than 12 months, but less than 5 year.
These are normally used for buying fixed assets or capital.
Medium term finance is in-between of short and long term finance.

Below is a list of medium term finances: 
- Loan Capital 
- Leasing 
- Subsidies

### Long-Term

Long term finance last longer than 5 years. Mortgages and all equity finance belong in this category.

Below is a list of long term finance: 
- Share Capital 
- Venture Capital 
- Business Angel 
- Loan Capital 
- Grants

## Evaluation of Sources of Finance

Often times, companies have to make decision on which source of finance to choose.
Different methods of finance have different purposes, with different opportunity cost and effectiveness.

There is three general idea for choosing sources of finance, `gearing`, `purpose`, and `ownership`.

### Gearing

*This will be further explained in 3.6, Efficiency Ratio Analysis.*

Gearing ratio calculates the percentage of loan capital versus the total capital of the business.
Having a high gearing ratio makes the company risky in case they default on their loans.
However, having a high gearing ratio lowers the amount of ownership that needs to be split.

### Purpose

Consider the purpose of the funds when gathering finance. Determine if the source of finance falls into short, medium, or long term groups.

### Ownership

Different companies have access to different kinds of finance.
Sole traders and Partnerships have access to mostly internal sources of finance.
They can also take loans and use trade credit.
Bigger corporation generally cannot use personal funds, but can take advantage of equity for financing.

# Cost and Revenue

In order for a business to make money, its revenue must be larger than its cost.
In this section, we will discuss the different cost and revenue of a company.

## Classification of Costs

Cost can be split up into two major categories, `Fixed Cost` and `Variable Costs`.

### Variable Cost

Variable cost is cost that change directly due to production. These include material and labor used for production.

### Fixed Costs

Fixed cost is cost that is not effected directly with production.
For example, electricity bills remain relatively constant no matter the amount produced.
Although electrify is required to make the product, it is not effected directly by the amount produced.
Other fixed costs include rent, salaries, capital.

## Direct and Indirect Costs

Costs can also be clarified into `Direct Costs` and `Indirect Costs`.
Direct costs are those that directly impact the good and service a company produces.
For example, raw material is a direct cost, but coffee machine refills are an indirect cost.
Examples of direct costs are salary or utility, while examples indirect costs are infrastructure cost and advertising.

# Revenue and Revenue Streams

`Revenue` is the money earned from the selling of goods and services.
It is different than profit, in that profit is revenue minus cost.
Simply, revenue can be calculated by the selling price of a product times the amount sold.

`Revenue streams` are methods of generating revenue.
Many companies do not earn money from just one source.
For example, a movie theater do not earn money just from selling tickets, but also food and drinks.
Or newspapers that do not earn money just from selling newspapers, but also from advertisements.

# Break-Even Analysis

In order to maintain a health revenue and cost relationships, many companies use `break even analysis` to plan ahead.
Break even analysis allows a company to find how much it need to sell in order to _break even_ (profit is greater than zero).

## Calculating the Break-Even Point

There are several units used in the calculation that have to be noted.

- __Fixed Cost:__ cost not effected by change of production 
- __Variable Cost:__ cost directly effected by change of production 
- __Contribution per Unit:__ the price per unit minus the variable cost per unit 
- __Break Even Point:__ the unit of product sold that the total profit is zero 
- __Margin of Safety:__ the difference between the current unit sold and the break even point

The break even point can be calculated using the following equation:
$$\frac{\textrm{Fixed Costs}}{\textrm{Contribution per Unit}}$$

## Break-Even Charts

Break even chart shows the break even point against unit sold and profit.
The $x$ axis is output, or the amount sold. The $y$ axis is revenue and cost.

There are three lines.
The first line is the `Fixed Cost`, which is a parallel line with equation $y=\texttt{fixed cost}$.
The second line is the `Total Cost`, which starts at the fixed cost, and increase over time.
It's equation is $y = \texttt{variable cost per unit} \cdot x + \texttt{fixed cost}$.
The last line is the Total Revenue, which starts at zero.
It has the equation $y = \texttt{contributions per unit} \cdot x$

The point at which `Total Revenue` intersects `Total Cost` is the break even point.
Draw a line from the Break even point to the $x$ axis.
The difference between the break even point and the actual output is the margin of safety.

## Evaluation of Break-Even Analysis

Break even analysis is easy to use, and show the important information that keeps the company alive.
A company can use break even analysis predict how changes in production can change the profit levels.
However, break even analysis is not very accurate.
It ignores a companies' inventory and economies of scale. It assumes all products are sold at the same price.

# Final Accounts

In order for business to understand what is going on in their company, they often gather data to create a final account.
A final account provides insight into the finance of the company overall.
Final accounts are created periodically, often at the end of a business year.
However, note that final account only accounts for the business at their current state.
What happens in the future is not factored in.

## Purpose of Final Account to Stakeholders

Internal stakeholders often look to final accounts for information about the company's health.
Management might look at the final account for planning and organizing.
While employees might look at a final account to see the financial stability of a company.

External stakeholders look at the final accounts for different reasons.
The government may look into the final accounts to make sure the company is following regulations and paying taxes.
Competitors may look into the final accounts to compare profits and financial strength.

## Figures

![Balance Sheet](./figures/unit 3/bs.png)

![Profit and Loss Account](./figures/unit 3/pl.png)

## Intangible Assets

Although we can calculate a value for most assets, some assets have intangible value.

- __Patents:__ legal protection that protects an invention for a set number of years. 
- __Copyright:__ similar to patents, but for artistic works 
- __Brand:__ the brand image of a company 
- __Registered Trademark:__ a distinctive symbol of the company. 
- __Goodwill:__ the difference between the purchasing price of a company and its net assets

## Depreciation

Over time, fixed assets decrease in value. It is often hard to sell something at the same value as you bought it, especially after a few years.

### Causes of Depreciation

Often times, depreciation is caused by wear and tear.
Capital such as factories or equipment will get older over time, be prone to breaking.
This decrease the value of the fixed asset.

Another cause is obsolescence.
This happens when newer technology arrives, and render the current product outdated.
In this case, the fixed asset will also decrease in value.

### Calculating Depreciation

IB supports two methods of calculations depreciation: `The Straight Line` method and `Reducing Balance` method.

The straight line method assumes the asset decrease in value at a fixed rate.
Use this equation to calculate the decrease in value per unit of time.

$$\textrm{Depreciation per unit of time} = \frac{\textrm{Purchase Price} - \textrm{Residual Value}}{\textrm{Estimated useful life}}$$

The reducing balance method assumes the asset reduce in value by a percent of its value.

The straight line method is easier to calculate, and easy to plan around.
However, it is not as accurate as the reducing balance method.

# Profitability and Liquidity Ratio Analysis

## Profitability and Efficiency Ratio

Profitably ratios measures how efficient a company can use its resources to make money.

### Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

GPM is a measure of how profitable the core business activities are.
It is calculate with the following equation:

$$GPM = \frac{\textrm{Gross Profit}}{\textrm{Sales Revenue}} \times 100\%$$

The higher the ratio, the more the business earn from is revenue.
There is no good ratio, as different companies have different ideal ratios.
Restaurants, for example, generally have lower GPM ratios while tech based companies have higher GPM ratios.

In order to improve GPM, one can change the price of the product.
The higher the price the more the company can earn per product.
However, be aware that changing the price can also effect the amount sold.
A company can also look to reducing cost.

### Net Profit Margin (NPM)

Net Profit Margin shows net profit as a percentage of sales revenue. Similar to GPM, but factor into fixed costs. Calculate NPM with the following equation:

$$NPM = \frac{\textrm{Net profit before interest and tax}}{\textrm{Sales revenue}} \times 100\%$$

The higher the ratio, the better the company is at managing overhead costs.

You can increase NPM Similar to GPM, but additionally decrease operation costs.

### Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

Return On Capital Employed measures how well a company can make money from capital. Use the following equation to calculate ROCE.

$$ROCE = \frac{\textrm{Net profit before interest and tax}}{\textrm{Capital Employed}} \times 100\%$$

In which `Capital Employed` can be calculated with the equation below:

$$\textrm{Capital Employed} = \texttt{Long Term Liabilities} + \texttt{Share Capital} + \texttt{Retained Profits}$$

The higher ROCE is, the better the company is at making money from capital.
Note that if ROCE is lower than the interest rate of a risk-free saving account, then a company is often not worth investing into.

In order to increase ROCE, a company can increase NPM.
They can also reduce long term liabilities.

## Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratio measures how well can a company sell its assets.
They can measure how well can a company pay off short term debts.

### Current Ratio

Current ratio measures how much a company own compared to how much they owe.
Calculate the current ratio with the equation below:

$$\texttt{Current Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Current Assets}}{\textrm{Current Liabilities}}$$

The higher the ratio, the healthier the company's total assets.
Note, companies want their current ratio to be above 1, as dropping below 1 means they do not have enough assets to pay off their debts.
However, if the current ratio is too high, then the company is at risk of wasting the money accumulated.
Different types of business have different current ratios.
For example, if a company have a steady cash flow, it is not as worried about gathering money to pay debts, and can live with a lower current ratio.

To improve the current ratio, a company can reduce its current liabilities.
They can also increase their credit system and sell unused fixed assets.
Decreasing overheads and negotiating for longer payment terms can also improve the current ratio.

### Acid Test Ratio

Acid Test Ratio measures a more severe indicator of a firm's ability to pay off short term debt, similar to the Current Ratio.
Stocks is subtracted from current asset, as it is not as liquid.
Use the equation below to calculate the Acid Test Ratio:

$$\texttt{Acid Test Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Current Assets} - \textrm{Stock}}{\textrm{Current Liabilities}}$$

Evaluate this ratio similar to the current ratio.

To improve the acid test ratio, a company can improve the current ratio.
They can also increase sales, which can turn stock into current assets.

# Efficiency Ratio Analysis

In this section, we will continue to look at ratios.
This section focuses on ratios that improve a company's efficiency.

### Stock Turnover Ratio

The Stock Turnover Ratio measures frequent a company have to replenish its stocks.
The more frequent, the company is better at converting stocks into sales.
Use the equation below the calculate the Stock Turnover Ratio.

$$\texttt{Stock Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\textrm{Average Stock}}$$

The higher the Stock Turnover Ratio, the better the company is at turning stock into sales.
Note, Stock Turnover Ratio does not apply to every company, especially companies that sell services.

Companies can improve this ratio by: 
- Lowering price 
- Increasing promotions 
- Stocking fast selling items 
- Buy stocks *just in time* 
- Use better sales forecast

### Debtor Days

Debtor days measures how well a company can collect its debt. Use the equation below to calculate Debtor Days:

$$\texttt{Debtor Days} = \frac{\textrm{Debtors}}{\textrm{Total Sale Revenue}} \times 365$$

Companies can increase Debtor Days by improving credit control.

### Creditor Days

Creditor Days measures the number of days a company settle its debts. Similar to Debtor Days, but for the company's debts. Use the equation below to calculate Creditor Days:

$$\texttt{Debtor Days} = \frac{\textrm{Creditors}}{\textrm{Cost of Goods Sold}} \times 365$$

Companies can improve creditor days but having a good stock control system, and having good relations with suppliers.

### Gearing Ratio

Gearing Ratio measures how much of a company's capital is funded by long term debt. A normal gearing ratio would be between $25\%$ to $50\%$. The higher the gearing ratio, the less control a company would have over itself. Also, interest and dividend will be higher with a higher gearing ratio.

Calculate the gearing ratio with the equation below:

$$\texttt{Gearing Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Loan Capital}}{\textrm{Capital Employed}} \times 100\%$$

To improve the gearing ratio, a company can increase retained profit. They can also pay up long term loans or swap debt for equity.

# Cash flow

`Cash Flow` measure the amount of cash entering and leaving a company.
In order for a company to survive, they have to keep a positive cash flow.
In fact, making a profit does not always equate to having a positive cash flow.
This section will go through measuring and planning for cash flow.

## Profit and Cash Flow

While profit is sales revenue minus total cost, cash flow is `cash inflow` minus `cash outflow`.
Cash inflow refers to any money received by a company, while cash outflow refer to any money spent by a company.
Revenue is a cash inflow, while cost is a cash outflow.

However, even if a company have a positive profit, they might still have poor `cash flow` (more net negative cash flow).
This can be caused by:
- __overstocking:__ too much stock will increase cash outflow
- __poor pricing strategy:__ inadequate cash inflow
- __high expenses:__ high cash inflow
- __over trading:__ too much outflow, little inflow
- __seasonal demands:__ little inflow

## Working Capital Cycle

`Working capital` is the `current asset` minus the `current liability`.
When the working capital become negative, the company will be unable to pay for its liabilities.

The `Working Capital Cycle` measures the time it takes for a company turn bought stock to cash.
The steps of the Working Capital Cycle is:
1. Cash
2. Creditors
3. Inventory
4. Debtors

If the working capital cycle is too long, a company may have cash flow issues.
Buying on credit or selling on credit may increase the cycle.

## Cash Flow Forecast

A `Cash Flow Forecast` shows a forecast cash flow for the next few months/years.
It has four major rows:
1. opening balance
2. cash inflow
3. cash outflow
4. net cash flow
5. closing balance

Below is an sample cash flow forecast:

| January               | February   | March    | April    | May        | June      | 6        |
| --------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| __Opening balance__   | 3,000      | 4,000    | 7,000    | 10,500     | 9,000     | 7,000    |
| __Cash inflows__      |            |          |          |            |           |          |
| Cash sales revenue    | 15,000     | 20,000   | 23,000   | 27,000     | 27,000    | 34,000   |
| Debtor payments       | 4,000      | 3,000    | 3,000    | 4,000      | 6,000     | 5,000    |
| Other income          | 0          | 2,000    | 0        | 1,000      | 0         | 0        |
| _Total cash inflows_  | 19,000     | 25,000   | 26,000   | 32,000     | 33,000    | 39,000   |
| __Cash outflows__     |            |          |          |            |           |          |
| Peanuts               | 5,000      | 8,000    | 8,000    | 11,000     | 12,000    | 12,000   |
| Packaging             | 1,000      | 1,500    | 1,500    | 2,500      | 4,000     | 4,000    |
| Rent                  | 2,000      | 2,000    | 2,000    | 2,000      | 2,000     | 2,000    |
| Wages                 | 6,000      | 6,000    | 6,000    | 8,000      | 8,000     | 8,000    |
| Suppliers             | 2,500      | 3,000    | 3,500    | 7,000      | 6,000     | 6,000    |
| Utilities             | 1,500      | 1,500    | 1,500    | 3,000      | 3,000     | 3,000    |
| _Total cash outflows_ | 18,000     | 22,000   | 22,500   | 33,500     | 35,000    | 35,000   |
| __Net cash flow__     | 1,000      | 3,000    | 3,500    | (1,500)*   | (2,000)   | 4,000    |
| __Closing balance__   | 4,000      | 7,000    | 10,500   | 9,000      | 7,000     | 11,000   |

You can denote a negative number by putting it in `(brackets)`.

Cash flow forecasts can help with business with taking account of future spending.
It can also help companies spot hard where they will have a lack of money and when they will earning a lot.

## Dealing with Cash Flow Problems

To improve Cash Flow, we can either increase cash inflow or decrease cash outflow.

### Increase Cash Inflow

- __Effective Debt Collect:__ make sure that money earned is recieved
- __Cash Transaction only:__ same as above
- __Increase Promotion:__ increase revenue/cash inflow
- __Expanding Product Portfolio:__ decrease risks due to varying demand

### Reducing Cash Outflow

- __Better Stock Management:__ decrease excess stock
- __Renegotiate Credit Terms:__ increase time before paying, allowing better control over outflow
- __Reduce Expenses:__ decrease outflow
- __Leasing:__ reduce spikes in outflow (from buying capital)

### Finding Other Sources of Finance

If a company is having a hard time, they can look to other sources of finance for short term and long term funding.

### Limitations of Cash Flow Forecasting

Cash flow forecasting is only as accurate as the data provided.
Forecasting in general is also hard to perform, especially without information on competitors or changes in the market.
Unexpected events such as sudden breakdown in machinery can result in a deviation from the forecast.

# Investment Appraisal

When considering an investment, it is best to evaluate the investment.
We can measure this with 3 major factors:
- Payback Period
- Average Rate of Return (ARR)
- Net Present Value (NPV)

## Payback Period

Payback period is the amount of time it will take for the investment to repay itself.
Payback period is calculated by calculating cash flow.
The cost of the investment is the cash outflow, and the money earned by the investment is the cash inflow.
When the net cash flows is equal zero, the investment would have payed back itself.

This can be done easier with a cash flow forecast table:

| Year | Cash inflow | Cash outflow | Net cash flow | Cumulative net flow |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 0    | $0          | $200,000     | -$200,000     | -$200,000           |
| 1    | $80,000     | $20,000      | $60,000       | -$140,000           |
| 2    | $140,000    | $60,000      | $80,000       | -$60,000            |
| 3    | $240,000    | $120,000     | $120,000      | $60,000             |
| 4    | $360,000    | $200,000     | $160,000      | $220,000            |

`Cumulative Net Flow` is the net cash flow added together since the first year.

To find the exact payback period in the year, use this equation:

$$\texttt{Payback Period} = \frac{\textrm{Amount left to pay}}{\textrm{Net cash flow in that year}} \times 12\;\textrm{months}$$

## Average Rate of Return

ARR measures the percent money earned from the investment each year.
Use this equation to find ARR:

$$(\textrm{Total Returns} - \textrm{Capital Cost}) \div \textrm{Years of Use} \div \textrm{Capital Cost} \times 100\%$$

Having a higher rate of ARR means the investment earns more money percent wise.
We can use this value to compare to other investment, to see which one earns more.
It is important to know that normally a higher ARR means a higher risk.
If an investment have a lower ARR than interest, than its often times not worth the investment, since interest from the bank is a safer.

## Net Present Value

NPV accounts for depreciation for the net cash flow.
It is calculated using a provided table of `Discount Rates`.

__Table of Discount Rate__
| Year | Discount rate |        |        |        |        |
|------|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|      | 4%            | 6%     | 8%     | 10%    | 20%    |
| 1    | 0.9615        | 0.9434 | 0.9259 | 0.9091 | 0.8333 |
| 2    | 0.9246        | 0.89   | 0.8573 | 0.8264 | 0.6944 |

# Budgets

Budgeting is the act of creating `budgets`, plans for the business in the up coming years.
Budgeting help companies measure goals and find out how well they did.
Budgets can be made for different departments, the whole company, or a single product.
Budgets generally contains information on the planned monetary values of the objects.

## Variances

When a company look at a past budgets, they can decide if they performed better or worse than the budget.
- __Favorable Variance:__ better than budget
- __Adverse Variance:__ worse than budget
- __No Variance:__ same as budget

Note, if the actual cost is lower than the budget, it is favorable.
However, if the actual revenue is lower that the budget, it is adverse.

Below is a sample budget:

|                 | Item                              | Budgeted | Actual  | Variance | Favourable or adverse? |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| Revenue         | Revenue from rooms                | £10,000  | £12,000 | £2,000   | Favourable (F)         |
|                 | Revenue from food and drink sales | £2,500   | £1,900  | £600     | Adverse (A)            |
|                 | TOTAL REVENUE                     | £12,500  | £13,900 | £1,400   | Favourable (F)         |
| Costs           | Staffing costs                    | £6,600   | £7,000  | £400     | Adverse (A)            |
|                 | Marketing costs                   | £400     | £400    | £0       | No variance            |
|                 | Food and drink costs              | £1,250   | £950    | £300     | Favourable (F)         |
|                 | Utilities costs                   | £600     | £650    | £50      | Adverse (A)            |
|                 | Cleaning and miscellaneous costs  | £320     | £400    | £80      | Adverse (A)            |
|                 | TOTAL COSTS                       | £9,170   | £9,400  | £230     | Adverse (A)            |
| Forecast profit |                                   | £3,330   | £4,500  | £1,170   | Favourable (F)         |

Variance is calculated as the difference between the budgeted value and the actual value.
