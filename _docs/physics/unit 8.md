# 8.2 Energy Transfer






## Stefan Boltzmann Law

$P=\sigma AT^4$

where:
$P$ = Power ($W$)\\
$\sigma$ = $5.67 \cdot 10^{-8} Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$ (Stefan-Boltzmann's Constant)\\
$A$ = $4πr^2$ where $r=\text{Orbital Radius}$\\
$T$ = Temperature of body in Kelvin ($K$)

The emissivity $e$ of a body between 0—1 quantifies (ratio) the emission and absorption peroperties of that body as comapred to a black body of equal size. 

## Emissivity

A black body is a perfect emitter or absorber of radiation and has an emissivity of $e=1$. 
i.e. $e_{Charcoal} = 0.95$

A body that cannot emit or absorb radiation has an emissivity of $e=0$. 
a. $e_{mirror} = 0.05$

For a black body, the power is given as:

$P=e\sigma AT^4$\\
where $e$ = $0~1$ (Emissivity)

## Albedo

Refers to scattered and incident power where:

$\text{albedo} = \frac{P_{\text{scattered}}}{P_{\text{incident}}}$


## Thermal Energy Transfer

## Greenhouse Gases
**Greenhouse Effect:**\\
**Gases**:
1. Methane: $\text{CH}_{4}$
2. Carbon Dioxide: $\text{CO}_{2}$
3. Nitrogen

## Scattering
Greenhouse gases are molecular. We can consider the $\text{CO}_{2}$ molecule, with two oxygen atoms connected to a carbon atom. 

Molecules have internal potential energy, which does not contribute to the temperature of $\text{CO}_2$, rather the kinetic energy ($E_K$) does. A molecule can gain and store $E_K$ through **vibration**, **translation**, or **rotation**. 

**Vibration**: Molecular atoms oscillate. The *natural frequency* of GHGs is in the infrared spectrum (heat).\\
**Translation**: The molecule moves as a unit in a straight line.\\
**Rotation**: Molecules spin by their center of mass. 

Incident infrared radiation is absorbed by the molecules, adding to its total energy and move along these $E_K$ modes until the energy is transferred as heat.
