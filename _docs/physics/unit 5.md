# 5.1 Electric Fields

## Essential idea:
When charges move an electric current is created.​

## Nature of science: 
Modeling: Electrical theory demonstrates the scientific thought involved in the development of a microscopic model (behavior of charge carriers) from macroscopic observation. The historical development and refinement of these scientific ideas when the microscopic properties were unknown and unobservable is testament to the deep thinking shown by the scientists of the time. 

## Understandings: ​

• Charge ​

• Electric field ​

• Coulomb’s law ​

• Electric current ​

• Direct current (dc) ​

• Potential difference 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Identifying two forms of charge and the direction of the forces between them ​

• Solving problems involving electric fields and Coulomb’s law ​

• Calculating work done in an electric field in both Joules and electronvolts ​

• Identifying sign and nature of charge carriers in a metal ​

• Identifying drift speed of charge carriers ​

• Solving problems using the drift speed equation ​

• Solving problems involving current, potential difference and charge 

## Guidance: ​

• Students will be expected to apply Coulomb’s law for a range of permittivity values

## International-mindedness: ​

• Electricity and its benefits have an unparalleled power to transform society ​

## Theory of knowledge: ​

• Early scientists identified positive charges as the charge carriers in metals, however the discovery of the electron led to the introduction of “conventional” current direction. Was this a suitable solution to a major shift in thinking? What role do paradigm shifts play in the progression of scientific knowledge?

## Utilization: ​

• Transferring energy from one place to another (see Chemistry option C and Physics topic 11) ​

• Impact on the environment from electricity generation (see Physics topic 8 and Chemistry option sub-topic C2) ​

• The comparison between the treatment of electric fields and gravitational fields (see Physics topic 10) ​

## Aims: ​

• Aim 2: electrical theory lies at the heart of much modern science and engineering ​

• Aim 3: advances in electrical theory have brought immense change to all societies ​

• Aim 6: experiments could include (but are not limited to): demonstrations showing the effect of an electric field (eg. using semolina); simulations involving the placement of one or more point charges and determining the resultant field ​

• Aim 7: use of computer simulations would enable students to measure microscopic interactions that are typically very difficult in a school laboratory situation

# 5.2 Heating Effect of Electric Currents:

## Essential idea: 
One of the earliest uses for electricity was to produce light and heat. This technology continues to have a major impact on the lives of people around the world.​

## Nature of science:  
Although Ohm and Barlow published their findings on the nature of electric current around the same time, little credence was given to Ohm. Barlow’s incorrect law was not initially criticized or investigated. This is a reflection of the nature of academia of the time with physics in Germany being largely non-mathematical and Barlow held in high respect in England. It indicates the need for the publication and peer review of research findings in recognized scientific journals. 

## Understandings: ​

• Circuit diagrams ​

• Kirchhoff’s circuit laws ​

• Heating effect of current and its consequences ​

• Resistance expressed as R = V /  I​

• Ohm’s law ​

• Resistivity R = pL / A​

• Power dissipation 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Drawing and interpreting circuit diagrams ​

• Identifying ohmic and non-ohmic conductors through a consideration of the V /  I characteristic graph ​

• Solving problems involving potential difference, current, charge, Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, power, resistance and resistivity ​

• Investigating combinations of resistors in parallel and series circuits ​

• Describing ideal and non-ideal ammeters and voltmeters​

• Describing practical uses of potential divider circuits, including the advantages of a potential divider over a series resistor in controlling a simple circuit 

• Investigating one or more of the factors that affect resistivity experimentally​

 ## Guidance: ​

• The filament lamp should be described as a non-ohmic device; a metal wire at a constant temperature is an ohmic device​

• The use of non-ideal voltmeters is confined to voltmeters with a constant but finite resistance ​

## International-mindedness: ​

• A set of universal symbols is needed so that physicists in different cultures can readily communicate ideas in science and engineering​

## Theory of knowledge: ​

• Sense perception in early electrical investigations was key to classifying the effect of various power sources, however this is fraught with possible irreversible consequences for the scientists involved. Can we still ethically and safely use sense perception in science research?

## Utilization: ​

• Although there are nearly limitless ways that we use electrical circuits, heating and lighting are two of the most widespread ​

• Sensitive devices can employ detectors capable of measuring small variations in potential difference and/or current, requiring carefully planned circuits and high precision components

• The use of non-ideal ammeters is confined to ammeters with a constant but non-zero resistance ​

• Application of Kirchhoff’s circuit laws will be limited to circuits with a maximum number of two source-carrying loops

## Aims: ​

• Aim 2: electrical theory and its approach to macro and micro effects characterizes much of the physical approach taken in the analysis of the universe ​

• Aim 3: electrical techniques, both practical and theoretical, provide a relatively simple opportunity for students to develop a feeling for the arguments of physics ​

• Aim 6: experiments could include (but are not limited to): use of a hot-wire ammeter as an historically important device; comparison of resistivity of a variety of conductors such as a wire at constant temperature, a filament lamp, or a graphite pencil;

# Electric Cells:

## Essential idea: 
Electric cells allow us to store energy in a chemical form.​

## Nature of science: 
Long-term risks: Scientists need to balance the research into electric cells that can store energy with greater energy density to provide longer device lifetimes with the long-term risks associated with the disposal of the chemicals involved when batteries are discarded. 

## Understandings: ​

• Cells ​

• Internal resistance ​

• Secondary cells ​

• Terminal potential difference ​

• Electromotive force (emf) 

## Applications and skills: ​

• Investigating practical electric cells (both primary and secondary) ​

• Describing the discharge characteristic of a simple cell (variation of terminal potential difference with time) ​

• Identifying the direction of current flow required to recharge a cell ​

• Determining internal resistance experimentally ​

• Solving problems involving emf, internal resistance and other electrical quantities

## Guidance: ​

• Students should recognize that the terminal potential difference of a typical practical electric cell loses its initial value quickly, has a stable and constant value for most of its lifetime, followed by a rapid decrease to zero as the cell discharges completely

## International-mindedness: ​

• Battery storage is important to society for use in areas such as portable devices, transportation options and back-up power supplies for medical facilities ​

## Theory of knowledge: ​

• Battery storage is seen as useful to society despite the potential environmental issues surrounding their disposal. Should scientists be held morally responsible for the long-term consequences of their inventions and discoveries? ​

## Utilization: ​

• The chemistry of electric cells (see Chemistry sub-topics 9.2 and C.6)

• Aim 8: although cell technology can supply electricity without direct contribution from national grid systems (and the inherent carbon output issues), disposal of batteries and the chemicals they use can introduce environmental pollutants​

• Aim 10: improvements in cell technology has been through collaboration with chemists
